The sky was a deep shade of orange, the air thick with smoke and ash. I had been warned about the impending disaster, but I never thought it would be this bad. My goddamn neighbor's stupid cat had wandered off, and I had to go find it before it got itself killed. As I walked out the door, I saw my wife, Sarah, standing by the window, her eyes wide with fear. She knew something was wrong, but she didn't know what. \n\nI found that little shit of a cat hiding behind a dumpster in the alley. It looked up at me with its beady little eyes and let out this pitiful mewling sound. I swear to god, it was like it was trying to tell me something. As I picked it up, I noticed that the air had changed. The smoke and ash were getting thicker by the minute. \n\nI knew we had to get out of there, fast. I grabbed Sarah and the cat, and we made a run for our emergency shelter. We had built it in anticipation of just such an event. As we entered the shelter, I could hear the sounds of panic outside - people screaming, cars crashing, buildings burning... It was like the end of the world as we knew it. \n\nThe next few days were a blur. We huddled together, listening to the chaos outside, waiting for help to arrive. But it never came. The world above us was slowly suffocating, and we were trapped down here with no way out. \n\nAs the days turned into weeks, our supplies started to run low. I had to venture out to scavenge for food and water. It was a real bitch of a job, but someone had to do it. And then, one day, I stumbled upon something that would change everything... A small group of survivors, living in an abandoned school building on the other side of town. They were desperate for help, and I knew we could use some extra supplies. \n\nSo, I made my way over there, armed with nothing but a few cans of food and a bottle of water. What I found was a real surprise - they were all white supremacists, hell-bent on surviving the apocalypse at any cost. They saw me as an outsider, someone who didn't fit their little group. And they made it clear that I wasn't welcome. \n\nBut I had a plan. I knew that if we could work together, we could make it through this thing. So, I proposed a deal - in exchange for their help, we would share our resources and work together to survive. It was a risk, but it was worth it. And slowly but surely, they started to come around... \n\nNow, we're a small community of survivors, living off the grid and working together to make it through this new world. We've lost loved ones, friends, and neighbors along the way, but we're still here. And I'm proud to say that we're doing okay. We've learned to adapt, to survive in a world that's gone to hell... \n\nSo, that's my story - how I managed to survive the most catastrophic climate change event in human history. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't pretty, but we made it through. And who knows? Maybe one day, we'll rebuild this world and make it a better place...\n    \n    Modify it so that:\n    \"title\" is the title of the story, it can also be question (if the story is an AITA story or an AMA story)    \n    \"seed\" must be a small sized prompt that will be used to generate an image that will represent the art style and appearance of the characters in the story. \n    each of the parts must be a small sized prompt that explains very simply what is going on in the scene in a still frame, it should include characters (only decsription of them) and an environment.\n    There are 24 parts in total so each of these images must illustrate 1/24 of the story.\n    \"body\" should be the content from the story from the json object you created.
