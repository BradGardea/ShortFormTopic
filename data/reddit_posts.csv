Imaginary-Chemical-8,AITA for asking my coworker not to eat her cultural food in the break room? ,2024-11-15T13:11:48.050000+0000,3677,2244,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grw0wj/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_not_to_eat_her/,"I know how the title sounds, and I’m sure as you begin reading this post it’ll sound worse but please hear me out.
I (25f) have a wonderful coworker (54f), who I get along really well with. This coworker is Nepalese and I am a white woman. In the past she’s been kind enough to bring in different food from her culture for us all to try. I have zero problem with her, or anyone else, bringing in food from their culture and I’ve really enjoyed some of the dishes and sweets she’s brought- especially the barfi she brought in earlier this year for Diwali. My workplace has lots of different cultures and I usually don’t care what anyone else brings to lunch, at least until this situation.
A couple of weeks ago I noticed a horrible smell in the break room that was incredibly strong. It was kind of like if you farted into a sweaty sock and stuck it to your face. It was honestly inescapable within the room, even after I changed the rubbish bin. I didn’t know what it was, but ended up going outside and eating in my car. I figured it was just a one off but for every few days I’d smell it again! I genuinely had no idea where it was coming from. During this time I just ate outside the building, or in my car.
However, one day I walked in and it was somehow even stronger. This day happened to be a day I had the same break as Jane. I noticed she was eating a fruit and realised that’s where the smell was coming from. I asked what she was eating and she told me it was called durian (I think that’s how it’s spelt?) and she had only recently found a good market for them. I said I was glad she was enjoying it but mentioned that its smell was quite overpowering and left the room smelling afterwards. I asked her if she wouldn’t mind eating it at home, or going outside as the smell really lingers in the staff room. She said she never really noticed the smell but would do her best to do so. She seemed a bit annoyed but hasn’t brought it in to the break room since.
I was talking with a friend about this (also white) and she said I was behaving in a racist way towards my coworker and it was wrong to police her cultural food. I argued that it wasn’t a cultural thing and I’d have done the same if someone was microwaving fish or another smelly food. This has caused a debate between us about if what I did was offensive, and while I do still think I was right, I am beginning to question if I could be viewed as in the wrong. So reddit, am I the asshole?",,t3_1grw0wj,AITA
SpiteRound8170,AITA for rebuking a friend after she referred to my girlfriend as the “token Asian” leading to an awkward situation?,2024-11-15T13:05:16.432000+0000,2975,450,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grvwlg/aita_for_rebuking_a_friend_after_she_referred_to/,"My girlfriend is not from the same town as me, she recently moved here. Her and I have been dating for a few years but she’s a shy introvert girl and a bit socially awkward. We live in a western country so she’s kind of living between two cultures because she’s East Asian.
Anyway I have some female friends and I thought I could set her up with them and they could go on girl dates. And she could finally have some female friends here to hang out with rather than just me.
My gf liked the idea and my friends also were keen to get to know her .
They met up the first time and were planning stuff when one of the girls jokingly referred to my gf as the “token Asian”. (They’re all stereotypical white girls, as basic and stereotypically white as you can get) and it just felt so unnecessary and offensive to me. My gf laughed it off but I got angry and told them off and demanded they apologise to her.
The whole situation got very awkward and now the entire plans are cancelled. My gf thinks I overreacted and I ruined her chance to make friends",,t3_1grvwlg,AITA
weather_you_know,AITA for not coming home during the day to let my (23F) boyfriend’s (26M) dog out while I’m trying to finish my thesis?,2024-11-15T15:04:52.732000+0000,949,479,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grycau/aita_for_not_coming_home_during_the_day_to_let_my/,"My boyfriend of 3.5 total years and I have been living together for 1.5 years now in an apartment with one other roommate. My boyfriend got the dog (5M) around the time we met, and I love him. I take care of the dog every morning because my boyfriend doesn’t wake up early enough, but we both leave for the day around 7:30 a.m.
I’m in my third semester of my master’s program, and my advisor expects a first draft of my thesis in three weeks so I can graduate on time in May. I work best in my office, where I have a second monitor and space to spread out research materials. I also have ADHD and take medication, so I'm most productive in long, uninterrupted blocks of time before evening hours.
Previously, I could stay home late or come home early from school to help with the dog. My boyfriend's old job was only 15 minutes away from the apartment, so he could come home for lunch, and sometimes our roommate let the dog out at 3 p.m. Since October, my boyfriend started a new job 30 minutes away, and I'm now pulling 12-hour days with classes, teaching, grading, and my thesis.
This has led to arguments about the dog’s care. For example, today (Friday), I planned to work on my thesis all day in my office since I have no meetings, labs, or classes. However, as I was leaving, my boyfriend told me that I needed to at least come home once during the day to let the dog out. I reminded him that it takes me 30 minutes to commute each way (15-20 minutes of walking to my car + 10 minute drive) and that I work best with uninterrupted blocks of time. He accused me of deliberately avoiding responsibility and said I should help because I had no other obligations. I told him that I am happy to take care of the dog when I can, but that he shouldn't expect me to take care of him more than I actually can.
I already take the dog out every morning at around 7:15 a.m., but that leaves a long gap until our roommate comes home at 3 p.m. While I feel bad about that, I cannot afford delays in my thesis timeline. If I do not graduate on time, we'll have to renew our lease and might end up paying for two leases if I can't find a job in this city (I’ve been searching for months, and there aren’t many options in my field here).
I've talked to him about paying for a dog walker or paying our roommate to take him out every day, but he is strongly against those ideas, although he just got a raise. I think he sees this as a test of my commitment to the relationship, though we've both said we want to get married.
The icing on the cake is that I've always wanted a cat, and my plan was always to get one after I graduated. However, he said that I can't get one. He expects me to take time out of my studies to take care of his dog but yet won't let me get my own furry friend.
So, AITA for refusing to come home during the day to take care of his dog while trying to finish my thesis?",,t3_1grycau,AITA
Dry-Belt-115,AITA for refusing to help my family clean up after Sunday lunch?,2024-11-15T17:16:23.651000+0000,591,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs1dxi/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_family_clean_up/,"I (19F) usually go with my parents and my brother to my grandparents house on Sunday for lunch along with other members of my family (an aunt, two uncles, two female cousins and two male cousins). Since I was little things have always been the same. My grandfather cooks because my grandmother is in a wheelchair and cannot help him, we arrive and eat and then the women clean up. I always hated this because the moment we are done eating my aunt stands up and says “Girls, come and help us”. So while we take away the dishes and wash them the men just sit there and talk, they don’t even make the effort of putting their fork and knife inside the plate when they are done eating, they just sit and wait for us to take it away like we are their servers. I help every time without saying anything because I don’t want to cause a scene even if it makes me really angry. Last week I wrote a message in the family group chat saying that on sunday the men were going to help to clean up because they never do and my female cousins and my kin backed me up, but on sunday when we were done eating just the women got up as usual and my aunt called only for the girls to help. I felt so angry that I just went to sit on the couch and declared that I was not going to move a finger until the men did. Obviously nobody did anything and I was furious. That evening I got a call from my cousin (29F) saying that I was rude for refusing to help and leave them to do all the work, so I said that she never told this to her dad or any of my male cousins and hung up the call.

Dependent-Student472,AITA for telling my sister and boyfriend the inappropriate thing my BIL said to me?,2024-11-15T17:13:04.899000+0000,469,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs1b5x/aita_for_telling_my_sister_and_boyfriend_the/,"I (25F) live with my sister, Emily (27F), her husband Connor (25M), and their son Owen (1M) due to a variety of reasons, none of which are relevant to this story. The other night (11/13/24), my boyfriend Marcus (26M) came over to hang out and some athletic snuggling ensued. After Marcus had left, I heard the baby crying and ended up in the hallway with Emily and Connor after Owen was put back to sleep. Emily had asked if Marcus was still in my room, and I told her no, he had left. Connor then says ""Thank god, I could hear you downstairs with my noise cancelling headphones on!"" I was, reasonably, embarrassed that he had heard anything and even more so mortified that he had said that in front of my sister. I apologized and hoped that was the end of it.
As Emily goes back downstairs, Connor turns to me and says ""Don't be sorry, now I have something to think about the next time I masturbate."" I tried to brush it off, as Connor often makes inappropriate remarks and I have always just ignored him in the past. I jokingly said ""Don't you mean you'll be thinking about Marcus?"" and he responded ""No, Marcus is too quiet, I didn't hear him. I only heard you."" Connor then goes back downstairs and I retreat to my bedroom. I couldn't stop thinking about what he'd said and how uncomfortable it made me, so I texted Marcus to ask him if I was overreacting.
Marcus was absolutely FURIOUS. He wanted me to tell Emily, but I was hesitant, as I didn't want to make Emily and Connor fight. I told him I would talk to her in the morning, hoping it would blow over and Marcus would forget about it, but he texted Emily. Emily then came into my room, and I started crying, saying that Connor's comment had bothered me but I didn't want to make it a big deal. Emily said that she would talk to Connor about it in the morning and make him apologize. I told her it didn't matter and it wasn't a big deal, but she insisted that he needed to apologize for it, especially since he has made inappropriate comments before and knows they make me uncomfortable.
The next day (11/14/24), I could tell something was tense between Emily and Connor, but I came home late, so I didn't interact with them much. Right before I went to bed, Emily asked me if Connor had apologized and I told her I hadn't even talked to him, so no. Today (11/15/24), I heard Connor and Emily arguing downstairs, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Eventually, Connor storms upstairs and I hear him say, ""No, I'm not going to! It's not my fault that none of you can take a f*cking joke!"" I know they were talking about Wednesday night. I knew Emily would be upset, but I didn't know Marcus would be so angry, and I didn't know it would cause this giant fight between Emily and Connor. AITA for saying anything at all?
EDIT: I hear them having sex REGULARLY. It seems like people think the issue is that we were heard, but the issue is what he said about it. They made a baby in this house, Marcus and I hear them all the time when we're just hanging out here.",,t3_1gs1b5x,AITA

I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.
My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.
I was ready to either hang up or tell her off, but what she said at the end sparked an idea. I tell her ""Okay, what's your address?"" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There's a pause before she says that's not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up.
This is where I probably became the asshole. Out of curiosity I easily found her address(her SM is not private at all) and email her ""how does this email sound?"" with an excerpt to the group email chain saying that Lorna has offered to host Sam's birthday party at her home and to come after school to X address. I was NOT planning on actually sending that to anyone else but her, I just wanted to prove the point and felt I was being sarcastic but I know tone is hard online. She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore.
When I vented to my husband about it he called me unhinged but he agreed with my point. I'll admit, I have a bit of a habit going overboard when I feel wronged and probably went nuts, but I can't believe the audacity of this lady. AITA.",,t3_1grl6av,AITA

His doctors say at this stage his life expectancy can be anywhere from three to five years. He knew this was coming and he set his affairs when he still had a sound mind. He gave me power of attorney and he made me the executor of his estate. The state laws here and the terms of my dad's power of attorney document gives me the power to sell or transfer anything. Effectively, I'm in complete and total control of his estate. I'm the youngest of four (two older brothers and a sister) and there is a large age gap between me and my three  siblings. I'm 18 years younger than my sister who is the next youngest. Because of the age difference, we were never close.
When my dad told all of us about his estate planning decisions, I could tell my siblings were really apprehensive about how much power my dad gave me but I told them everything from that point our dad's estate would effectively be frozen. I'll find management companies to take care of his properties and the money will go back into the estate for his care. I'm not selling anything, I'm not buying anything, and I'm going to follow our dad's wishes to the letter. When our dad passes, we'll divide up the estate according to his will. Everyone was happy with that.
In my dad's will he left my brother some property. My brother is now asking me to use my power of attorney to sell the property our father left to him and transfer the money to him now. He needs it to keep his business running while he bids for a big contract he says he can win and that will allow him to keep the business running long term. He says the property will eventually go to him and he's going to sell it so the end result is the same, it's just a timing issue. I refused, and reminded him that I promised everyone I wasn't going to sell anything or make any changes and I'm not making any exceptions. He gets upset and calls me an asshole for holding up his inheritance and an even bigger asshole because I will be screwing over all the people who work for him. But my dad is still alive! He's not dead and I'm just not willing to go through his pockets while he's still breathing. My other brother agrees with me while my sister agrees with my brother. AITA",,t3_1grqk0o,AITA

Hey Reddit, I’m (21F) and currently a junior in college, working part-time, and living at home to save on rent. My mom (42) is a single parent who ended up with a surprise baby a couple years ago. I don’t have any biological siblings myself, so this little guy is my first “sibling” experience.
Recently, my mom sat me down and said that with everything going on, she really needs “more hands on deck” with the baby. She asked if I could start taking on a lot more responsibilities with him, like picking him up from daycare, helping with meals, and basically being a live-in babysitter.
I told her that I already have a busy schedule with work and classes, and while I love my little brother, I’m not in a position to take on the role of a second parent. She seemed really hurt and said things like, “But family steps up for each other,” and that since I’m the only other “adult in the house,” it’s only fair I pull my weight.
After a lot of thought (and a little heartbreak), I decided to move out. I can afford a small apartment with a couple of roommates, but obviously, money is going to be a lot tighter now. When I told her, she got really upset, saying I was “abandoning” the family when they needed me and that I’m being selfish.
I’m torn because I feel bad about leaving my mom in a tough spot as she’s always worked so hard to provide me the most, but I also feel like I didn’t sign up to be a co-parent and staying at home will really hinder my future. AITA for moving out?",,t3_1gs0r3z,AITA

We were pretty close with my aunts/uncles/cousins, often living together with one family unit in a single room (around 15 people in the house), however we didn't have much contact with non-family members. As kids, we weren't allowed to have friends. We were allowed to go to school, but had to come back home when it ended. No hanging out with classmates and no after school activities. For me, personally, being the youngest one, I was usually an afterthought, even for my parents. Needless to say, I was suffering from depression.
I moved out of the house when I went to college, and started exploring my freedom. However, even then, I was expected to call everyday and come back home every weekend. As time went on, I started to distance myself by skipping phone calls and not going back every weekend. Eventually. I broke off all contact with my family.
A year after graduating, I had a pretty stable life for myself and I thought to get back in touch with at least my parents and siblings. The first few conversations (over phone) were just them yelling at me, and I endured it. After months of this, we were finally able to have some conversation. And every time, I was the one who called. When I finally visited back home there was more yelling and they expected me to move back into the house. I refused their demand, which lead to more yelling again. This continued for a few more months without any progress. So, I started to distance myself again. That was over a decade ago.
Last year, I started to get phone calls from several family members. However, every single call follows the same routine; first they try to make me feel guilty about breaking contact and not calling or visiting (I just hang up if they start yelling), and then they want something from me. Usually they want money or have some of my cousins move in with me. My response to that is always no.
So, am I the asshole?

My husband is a vegetarian and I am not. He was vegetarian when we met and I have always respected it and he has always not been bothered by me eating meat. At home I have always eaten vegetarian since we cohabited, out of convenience for eating together.
When we had a child (now 4) we decided to raise him vegetarian. It is a strong belief of my husband, a neutral thing for me. I wanted to respect his beliefs. I do the cooking and cook vegetarian food for our son.
My son is v. smart and began to pick up whether I was vegetarian or not from 2 and a half onwards - this was developmentally earlier than I was expecting. Arguably, I didn't deal with it the best way initially. I told my son I would go vegetarian after he said things like ""I want you to be vegetarian and kind to animals, mummy"". This reasoning of his came from me - I have always tried to enhance my husband's views in my son by explaining were raising hom vegetarian as it's important to be kind to animals. He conceptually understands death, from living in the countryside and knows that you eat dead animals if having meat. This is where this comment of his came from.
However, after telling my son I was vegetarian I still ate meat when not around him. Now to the AITA bit... I have, on occasion, snuck some meat into my order when eating out with him. For example, having a sosauges sandwich and saying it was veggie sausages. I know it's wrong to lie to kids, but I thought of it as a white lie. I kicked the can down the road to deal with all this when he's older.
Today I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and the waitress announced it on delivery. My son picked up on this and, not upset too much, but told me I'd done bad behaviour. My husband was there and has told me he's furious at me. Not because of not being vegetarian, but because I lied to our son and then tried to sneak a bit of meat at lunch time.
I feel this whole thing has been tricky to navigate and I've never even had a thank you for recognition from my husband that I have tried.

Growing up I was led to believe we were essentially poor and just scraping by. Asking to participate in school related or other activities that required money was always a no. I started working at a young age, bought my own car, insurance, etc. Everything I had as an adolescent I earned myself. As I got older realized both my parents had decent paying jobs, money was coming in and they were even putting some money away for retirement, despite the impression they gave me. Around the time I left to live on my own, they started spending above their means. Long vacations to tropical destinations, new cars every year, they even boat a boat. They also purchased several time-shares as well as got involved in MLM and get rich quick type schemes. To ""afford"" it they repeatedly re-financed their home, resetting the mortgage and taking out equity.  They would also open credit cards and transfer balances around to get promotional rates without paying down the debt. The frustrating part if that over the years they would ask me for advice about various financial decision or a new scheme they found. I would take my time to research and explain why I didn't think it was a good decision. In every single case, they ignored my advice and did whatever they wanted. Ok now for the big event ... they call me not too long ago and proceed to tell me that all of their money is gone, they are broke. They explained that over the past several years they have been emptying out their retirement accounts and putting it in a retirement “fund"" run by a good friend. Well it turns out this fund was a Ponzi scheme and as all Ponzi schemes eventually do it collapsed. I've gone through the full gamut of emotions since they told me. I'm angry that they decided to hide this ""fund"" from me for years, most likely because they knew I would tell them something wasn't right about it. How they bought into the promise of unrealistic returns, even with all the red flags. They had no reservations asking me for financial assistance. Even though they are retired they still have a mortgage, no surprise there. They floated the idea of me paying their mortgage for them, but without providing me any equity in return. I decided not to help them, I feel like they've never taken my advice, were excessively frugal when I was young, and even if I did help them they would probably find a way to squander it.",,t3_1gryhra,AITA

Before I moved with in with my partner, my daughter (F5) and I have always spent holidays with my parents. My partner would drive up when she could, depending on her work schedule and the road conditions. This year my partner and I decided to stay home for Thanksgiving for a multitude of reasons.
The first of which is because we want to begin our own traditions as a family in our first home together. The second of which is because of my partner’s work schedule. She will be working everyday from November 25th - December 7th, with the exception of Thanksgiving day. I am also making her staff a full meal to bring in on Black Friday and will need time to prep.
The third reason is that I have reached a point in my life where I believe I should not do whatever I am told by my mother and do what I want. It was very difficult for me to come out to my parents and almost harder to move away from them. My parents were abusive, kicked me out as a minor, and I spent many holidays homeless and alone. Once we reconnected, I have done everything to make sure they don’t discard me again. My mother has never apologized for anything she has done to me.
I have never made plans on holidays because I know they want me there, however they never check if I do have plans in the first place.
Tonight (11/14) I, my mother, and my daughter were on a FaceTime call just catching up. My mother said she would see us in a couple of weeks for Thanksgiving. I told her that we were not coming and she was shocked. I told her that my fiancé had to work and that I was making food for her staff the next day and with the road conditions, it seemed like a lot. She was immediately upset and said she bought things for my daughter and that if we weren’t going to come to her, she was going to come to us with my father. She began bawling and hung up the call with me. She then yelled at my father saying it was his fault we were not coming and he must have done something to upset us. She also asked my sister if she upset me. I began receiving calls from each family member asking if I was mad at them or what had happened.
At this point I was bawling my eyes out as I had never really set boundaries before with my mother and I did feel guilty. My fiancé and I talked about it and decided to cave in because I could not handle the stress.
I called my mom to apologize and she did not answer my call. I then sent her a long text, where I apologized profusely multiple times, explained that I was not upset with anyone, and that if they would still have us, we would love to go. It has been 6 hours and she has not responded to my text.
I do understand I should have let her know about this sooner, It was very difficult for me to tell her which also led to me avoiding the topic until she brought it up. Am I the asshole?",,t3_1grrlfw,AITA
Icy-Sun6781,AITA for not giving my late husband’s mom any of the life insurance money after she paid for his funeral?,2024-11-14T18:56:10.946000+0000,7175,2887,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grc8a6/aita_for_not_giving_my_late_husbands_mom_any_of/,"My first and hopefully last throwaway account.
My husband and I were both in our early 40s, married for 6 years, when he passed away suddenly a few months ago. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever faced, and honestly, I’ve just been trying to survive each day since. Right after he died, his mom (my MIL) stepped in and insisted on paying for all the funeral expenses. I was completely out of it, just in a fog, and really grateful for the help.
Here’s the thing: I totally forgot that my husband had a small life insurance policy through my job. I only remembered it recently and filed a claim, getting a payout. It’s not a huge amount of money, but enough to help me move back across the country to be with my family and maybe put something down on a modest home so I can start over.
When my MIL found out about the insurance payout, she flipped out. She’s demanding I pay her back for the funeral costs and accusing me of ‘using’ her son. She’s said some really hurtful things, calling me selfish and implying I’m somehow profiting off his death. But she offered to pay for the funeral, and I truly didn’t know about the insurance money at the time. I’m still so broken over losing him, and the thought of being called heartless just adds to the pain.
I know she’s grieving too, but I’m trying to do what’s best for me to heal and move forward. So, AITA if I don’t give her the money? I’m already barely holding it together and just need a chance to rebuild my life.
I’m ready, I hope- to handle the criticism that may be coming my way.",,t3_1grc8a6,AITA
cloudgirl298,AITA for telling my family I want to celebrate my birthday and not Christmas? ,2024-11-15T14:44:43.910000+0000,154,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grxwi8/aita_for_telling_my_family_i_want_to_celebrate_my/,"I (F16) had my 16th birthday this week (November) and the whole time my family just talked about Christmas, now don't get me wrong I like Christmas but ever since I could remember my mother and younger sister have always celebrated Christmas when it was my birthday.

Now I've accepted this fact but this week was different. My family went out of town to visit family on my birthday weekend and told me that we would do something for my birthday but when the day came my mom was with her friend and her daughter the whole time, my sister was only talking about Christmas and what she wanted and even shopping for herself while I sat in the car crying because I was being ignored.

JellyfishOne8356,AITA for hesitating to loan my GF's brother money?,2024-11-15T19:35:15.506000+0000,45,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs4nxb/aita_for_hesitating_to_loan_my_gfs_brother_money/,"My girlfriend (28F) and I (27M) have been together for about 6 months now. We were long distance for 2 months before I quickly moved out of my home state to hers. I work fully remote and make very good money, well into the 6 figures. She had a full time job that required her to be in the office and her state had more favorable costs of living, so it made sense. After living together for 2 months, she quit her main job to focus on building up her business. I told her I would support her through the transition, and she's been doing great and building up a substantial client base for herself. I pay the entirety of the rent on the house, all our groceries, I buy all the furniture and pay for anything and everything we need around our home. I even gave her one of my credit cards and I let her use it on hair, nails, etc.
A few days ago, she asked me to loan her brother $2,000 so he can make his monthly house payment. He is going through a bad divorce with a kid involved and is in the middle of a career change. I've only met him once but he seems like an honest guy. I make a lot of money, but I don't come from money. In the past, I was horrible with my finances and only recently started getting my stuff together. Yesterday I explained to her that I need to make sure I have enough liquidity to cover all necessary expenses over the next few weeks and that I wouldn't be able to dish out $2,000 without making sure that we wouldn't be in a tough situation and that I am uncomfortable with her asking me for money for her family being that we're still technically in a new relationship. She stormed off and said she needed to call clients and figure out how she was going to get a line of credit to cover the loan. I saw how unhappy she was as she stormed away, so I venmo'd her the $2,000. I texted her and told her I sent her the money for her brother. She text replied ""Why would you venmo it? That takes days to transfer ?"" and then stormed out of the house. She got in her car, drove off and ignored my phone call. When she came home 30 minutes later, she told me I was inconsiderate of her emotions and that she ""can tell I don't want to help"". She then guilted me after I already paid her and told me that she had seen real hardship in her life and that I hadn't. She told me that my world view is stingy and that she's concerned that I don't jump to help family financially no matter what. Then she started talking about how money isn't everything and that I should've made more of an effort to console her during this. I explained politely that her brother is not my family and that I have financial responsibilities that I need to secure before putting myself out of pocket and potentially into a stressful position. She just threw my income back in my face as if I should feel ashamed for what I spent years building up for myself.
I love her. Part of me worries that she may be taking advantage of me. When I talk to her about this, she makes me feel like an asshole. Am I?",,t3_1gs4nxb,AITA
Normal_redditorr,AITA for telling my dad he chose between me and his fiancée when he prioritized her surgery over mine?,2024-11-14T15:00:12.147000+0000,12131,652,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gr6nzh/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_chose_between_me_and/,"I(17f) have had a rocky relationship with my dad. My parents married after I was born, hoping to provide a stable family for me, but they divorced when I was 11 after my dad went to rehab, & things only worsened from there. During rehab, he met his current fiancée, and they later had a kid(6F). Since then, my dad has been mostly absent from my life—whenever I have important events, he either has an excuse or doesn’t show. I’d estimate he’s been present for less than half of my events since their divorce.
A few years ago, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, & initially, surgery wasn’t needed. However, my condition got worse, & I was finally scheduled for surgery on 11/20 of this year. I told my dad about it months ago, expressing how much I needed his support this time, & he promised he’d be there. But later, he texted to say he’d planned a vacation that would keep him away until mid-December, just as my recovery period would be ending. It broke my heart, but I accepted it.
Then, 2 hurricanes hit his vacation spot, & he told me he’d make my surgery. I felt a glimmer of hope. But then, just a week before my surgery, he texted again saying his fiancée’s lung cancer surgery had been scheduled for the same day, a few hours before mine, at a hospital 30 minutes away. He said he “might not” make it to my surgery, but with him, “might not” usually means “won’t.” He added that this wasn’t about who he loved more. That message shattered me. I realized that no matter how much I hoped, he might never give me the attention & support I needed. I broke down on my kitchen floor that day.
After sitting with my feelings, I texted him to tell him how deeply his actions hurt me. I said it wasn’t only about love but about showing care, & that he’d given me hope only to let me down again. I questioned if his fiancée’s surgery had really been scheduled last minute, or if he had known earlier but hadn’t told me. I asked him to show he was my dad through his actions, not just his words. He responded, insisting the surgery was only scheduled the day he’d told me. But because he’s lied in the past to save face, I reached out to someone who might know the truth.
I then sent a follow-up message, clarifying that my frustration wasn’t with his fiancée; it was with his ongoing absence & lack of support. I said that even if his reasons were genuine, he could have at least shown some empathy. I told him I hoped he’d be a better father for my half-sister than he has been for me. In a final message, I made it clear that I was done putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship on my own. I told him that if he wanted to be my dad, I would gladly be his daughter, but if he chose not to, I would be fine with that too.
He hasn’t responded, & honestly, I’d prefer he sit with what I’ve said. For once, I hope he really thinks about his actions & the impact they’ve had on me.

We've been together 10 years. One birthday he gave me custom engraved necklaces of our dogs and I loved it. This year for my birthday he asked what I wanted (which i hate) but I ended up picking out my own bag and ordered it myself. Now on to the part that makes me upset... at his job he works with all women, and he is their boss. They are doing secret Santa for Christmas and he got matched with a girl who loves to read and is into fantasy genres like dragons and magic. He bought her probably 7 different dragon themed little gifts and trinkets (tapestry, glass dragon egg, a little journal, etc....). none of them were super expensive, so if that was all it was I wouldn't have thought twice about it but he also crafted a hand made a mosaic of a bunch of diffent dragons that he stenciled on from images he found online. It looks great and he's super talented with things like that, but I can't help but be jealous and think ""why can't he do something like that for me?"" He spent hours on it and worked on it every night for a week. One of the gifts arrived in the mail yesterday and I said ""is this another gift for her?"" he said yes so I said ""I feel like you're going over the top and its a little unfair i had to pick my own gift for my birthday when you did all this for her"" He replied saying everyone goes over the top for the gift exchanges and it's not that deep... and that was the end of it. Also, I think part of it is he feels like it's a competition on who gives the best gift, because at previous exchanges there has been a clear ""winner"" who gave the best gift. He seems standoffish and short with me ever since we've had the conversation. Am I the asshole for brining it up?",,t3_1grfe50,AITA

I had been waiting excitedly for an entire month just to see him, made some decorations and wore his favourite clothes, ordered his favourite snacks etc., and was very disappointed and upset when he changed his plan last minute. He had no particular reason to want to stay one extra day, so that made me even more upset. The thing is, he has surprised me in the past by showing up earlier than he was supposed to, so i asked him at least 5 times whether he's lying to me because he wants to surprise me, because if he is, I would be really upset to be disappointed only to realise that it is not real and do not want to go through a set of negative emotions for no reason. He said he is being genuine and even sent me screenshot of the ""cancelled"" ticket. So, i let it go and took down the decor, changed, ate some of the snacks and cried myself to sleep.
But guess what happens? He shows up on the day (today morning) he was supposed to. I was obviously happy to see him but not as enthusiastic as I should have been. He asked me why I was being somewhat dry and distant, so I explained that I had told him very clearly that I did not want to feel disappointed for no reason and him telling me intricate lies that made me feel really sad, only to show up anyways made me feel like he did not value my feelings. He got mad and said I was being unreasonable because ""everyone likes surprises"". I told him that while usually I do too, this absolutely did not feel like a surprise, and left the room and went to my friend's room. I got a bunch of text messages from him saying I am being unreasonable and that I am overreacting. My friend also thinks that maybe I am being a bit unreasonable to leave him alone when I haven't seen him in so long, so now I feel a little guilty for walking out; AITA?
Edit: HOLY MOLY I did NOT expect this to blow up this much… I read through almost all your comments and if I’m being honest, I felt a little defensive of him. But your comments overwhelmingly convinced me that I should value my feelings more than I have so far. I also realised this is not the first time he hasn’t valued my feelings. I appreciate all of your comments and I had a long talk with him about this, and other times as well where my boundaries were not respected at all. And he absolutely did not get it. He half-heartedly apologised but took almost no accountability and I think this is the last straw honestly. I’m done putting in all the effort, and I will break up with him soon. It’ll be hard because I really thought this one actually cared lol, but yeah. Think I need to be single for a while now. Thank you so much again!",,t3_1gr7ysp,AITA

I (26F) am getting married soon to the most wonderul man (29M) ever! Let’s call him S. So it’s been a dream of mine since I was 13 to have a wedding by Lake Como and I always just treated it as a dream since it was too expensive, but fortunately, my fiancé and I have enough saved up to host this wedding. However, the issue is that both of us are Indian (we live in boston) and our family members back home will require visas. S’s family is slightly more well off than mine and will be able to afford the traveling costs. However, my mom’s side of the family (some people might remember my old post about my aunt asking my brother and I to pay her daughter’s tuition) is struggling financially and even if they can manage to travel, getting a visa will be hard for them as Schengen visas are hard to get for Indians, let alone those with low income. They’re saying that they cannot afford the tickets but they want to attend my wedding, so they want me to change my venue to somewhere within India. My parents are telling me I need to stop being selfish and my family has a right to be there to see me get married, which I agree with, but I really do not want to change my venue, afterall it’s been my dream since forever! I suggested a compromise to having a wedding in a really pretty Indian state. But even despite that, they’re saying that since my grandmother is pretty old and gets sick while traveling (even by car to distant places) and they want me to keep it within the state they live in (it’s a very boring state and I won’t get the kind of wedding I want there). S is siding with my family and says we could always just have the wedding in the state, but his parents disagree with him and are saying that since it’s our wedding, it should be our choice. S didn’t really have much of an opinion in picking a location and says he’s “okay with anything”. I really don’t want to give up my dream wedding, when I can well afford it. I do understand their problems but I can’t help but think that it’s my wedding and therefore it should be my decision. AITA?
UPDATE: So after a lot of thinking, I think it would be best to hold a wedding in India but not within my state. Another thing I just remembered was that my grandmother and my aunt’s family had gone on a roadtrip to a place about 2 hours from their home state about a year back (no changes in grandma’s health since) If they could travel 2 hours for a roadtrip, they can surely do that for my out of state wedding right?

My sister loves animals, and well... I don't. I rarely go to her house and when I do it's without my wife and kids.

Her dog is super obnoxious, not all that well behaved. It'll jump on you and that type of stuff. I wouldn't say it's dangerous, just annoying.
When the news about who is hosting came to me, I discussed it with my wife, said let's go to your families and my wife was good with that. I let my parents know and they said I was overreacting.

Not a combined house. I’m divorced. She is widowed and has remained close to her FIL. Still time to attend.
Her FIL passed a week and a half ago, funeral is tomorrow. I met him a few times and got along but I always felt awkward as he was her deceased spouses dad. I was never specifically invited to the funeral, but imagined I’d be going when he first passed. I’ve been supportive emotionally, but I’m not involved with the funeral.
Her BIL started giving her issues the day after his passing (not about me, but FIL supporting her) and I figured then, combined with not being specifically invited, that it was going to be just her side of the family going. I was fine with this as I didn’t want to add to or increase drama/stress. She has been stressed by BIL and that has only further cemented me not being there in my head.
Here we are a day prior and she has family coming in and mentioned me meeting them and I said “yeah, when”. Then it came out that we had different ideas… to her I was definitely going to the funeral, while I had gotten comfortable with the idea of not being invited and not causing drama with BIL. It caused a fight with me bringing up my concerns.
I’m concerned, and stated to her, that it’s a bad look for the new boyfriend (she took issue with the term new boyfriend, though I’d be new to his family) to attend when it’s that side of the family. I feel like there’s no good option for me to avoid being the AH… Supportive, but obviously causing drama or unsupportive, but no added drama. I have no idea which makes me less the AH.

But we share a bathroom and it’s just annoying waking up and having a man in the apartment using my bathroom and stuff when I’m trying to get ready and she’s not even here. I already talked to her about it a few weeks ago very nicely, and she agreed, but then proceeded to have him be here when she’s at work again twice. This time was a lot shorter, he’d see me and leave in 15-30 min, but this pissed me off more because I already told her that this made me uncomfortable and she proceeded to essentially tell him “it’s fine just leave when u see her”. Like what. Why is there a guy here without you? He also has been staying over like very very frequently which is annoying because he has a full house to himself less than 15 min away. So when this happened again recently I just got really mad and we had sort of an argument about it where she kept saying he was only here for ten minutes after she left, but then this story changed to thirty minutes. What’s funny is I literally introduced them to each other and like I try to be chill about this stuff but this is my home too and I don’t want an unsupervised man here. He also has a key to our apartment?????? Which she never even asked any of my roommates about???",,t3_1gs20lq,AITA

My gf asked if she could come over later on, and that she ""won't bother us."" After asking multiple times, I finally caved and let her come over.
She comes over smelling of alcohol and immediately starts playing the main character and takes over the conversation and runs the show.
She took my friend outside to see her new car which is fine of course, but again, we just wanted to chill since we only get to once or twice a year.
As the night went on her behavior began to change for the worse, telling us that the video game we were playing is dumb, and that I needed to come to bed since it was 1am...etc.
So, she finally walks away, and soon after the power goes off. I looked over at my friend confused and noticed some lights were still on so it didn't make sense.
But, then I figured it out...
SHE TURNED OFF THE ELECTRICITY!
In the middle of us playing.
On our guys night.
I walked to my bedroom and found her laying in my bed. I immediately told her how disrespectful that was and that him and I never get to hang out and she's overstepping her boundaries.
She didn't care. She stood by her decision to turn off the electric and that it was late and I needed to come to bed with her.
I told her that I would have NEVER done that to her and her friends. Finally my friend stepped in and told her off. They went back and forth and I eventually told her to leave. She refused.
My friend looked at my in the eyes and told me I need to get away from this girl.
I've afraid to move forward with her and she wants to move in together but I feel it would be miserable.
TL;DR: Best friend and I had a guys night. I told my gf she could come over after she asked multiple times. She turned off the electricity so I would come to bed. All hell broke loose.",,t3_1gs2lyp,AITA

Along with those plates, we had 3 plain plates. One of the plain white broke, and Tyler took all of his personal plates back into his room out of fear of them being broken.

With a few ups and downs we still manage to have a happy life. He recently moved across the US back to where we both used to live, he went for work. Before that he was staying with me and my parents and sisters in the south. He was able to get his own place and car and I miss having my family together. I plan on moving with him soon but can’t help but feel guilty. My parents have cried about me moving because they wanna be close to the baby. And I understand , they love her so much and it makes my heart shatter that I have to make a decision like this because either way it sucks. But I want my baby to have her father yk? So I do plan on moving next month in December . Don’t know how I’m going to tell my parents. Anytime something like that comes up they tell me I’m ripping my daughter from a loving home and no one will help me the way they do. So i feel torn :(
UPDATE: we did discuss the move. He wasn’t having any luck out here in the south and the field of work he’s in has more business out towards the west. My dad also had a problem with him and they would get into it and he got the job opportunity and I was going to go with him but my parents made me feel so bad I canceled my ticket last minute but I feel stuck. I want my family so I got a ticket for next month. Just feel bad for some reason.
INFO: I feel like there’s a lot more that goes into it but it’s just SO much to put down to how we ended in this situation. There was a time before this we were going to leave because my dad is a hot head and I hated that growing up I don’t want that for my daughter . He’s really good with her but when he’s mad he doesn’t care about much or talk to anyone but walk around angry. They then threatened to call cps on me to say that we weren’t gona be able to support our daughter. And would tell me I won’t be able to do it without them. I feel as if they made me think I can’t be a mom without them but in reality I can. I love my daughter endlessly and I want my family to thrive together ( my baby and her father ) .",,t3_1grzct6,AITA

He's got his own business, but things are a bit slow at the moment. I'm trying to help wherever I can, whether it's to help with his work or just help with house chores. We don't live together, but I stay over quite a lot.
Lately, he's been acting very distant from me. Doesn't want to involve me in gatherings with friends, etc. His excuse is that he wants some space. They would mostly go sit by a bar and drink. Now 3 things happen lately that really made me upset, but I'm not sure if I'm being wrong here:
His bestfriend's birthday was a recent. BF was directly invited, I was not. The invite included a plus 1. I only knew about it when his friend talked about it when we were out the one time. Some time has passes, and BF said nothing. When I mentioned it, he said I was not invited. That it is just going to be some guys and he is not sure if he's going either. Now, knowing how this friend is, I knew this was bullcrap. We fought a lot about it. We ended up going together, and it turned out to be a big party with not just a lot of guys, but girls as well. I let it slide..
A night before above mentioned party, on a Friday afternoon. As I got to his house after work, he mentioned that he wanted to get a beer with 2 of his friends. I asked if I could join. He declined. He said he wanted to spend some time with just them, and meet me up afterwards. Well, after he left I decided to go to another bar alone. After about 2hours he told me I should join them. When I arrived, I saw that there was another girl sitting with the 3 of them. She was one of the other guy's cousin. She was there from the start. I was upset as to why I had to wait for 2hours to join them, although she was there. Am I wrong for being upset about this?
On Sunday, we would've had a chilled day and making some nice Sunday meal. I helped around the house, I helped with a project he is busy with, and then to start with the preparation of the food. He got upset I about some spice I added. I went to lie down, as I felt he was rude. After a few minutes he just told me he's leaving. He got on his bike and left. Not telling me where he's going, how long he's going to be, not even if I want to join. He ended up joing some friends to drink at a bar. I lost it. I got highly upset about this. I fought with him and ended up packing my stuff and leaving for my place where I've been the entire week. He thinks I overreacted, but I feel so disrespected by him.
Now, we do have a bad past. And I know I'm going to be judged highly about this. He did previously emotionally cheat on me. Which included excluding me from places and things he do, as there was of course a reason he didn't want me there. After a lot of time working on this, some therapy. Things got a lot better. Things were going good, not great, but was improving.
So, am I being to much here?",,t3_1gs2852,AITA

As you may know, grief looks different in everyone. Personally, it has made me angry at everything and everyone. My 17F sister grieves by talking to her friends and trying to distract herself. At the breakfast table, she was on the phone with her friend, and I asked her if she could please put in her AirPods, or turn down the volume on her phone. She looked at me, and in a snarky voice goes “what is your issue?”. At that point, I was so overtired from not sleeping that I snapped and replied with “are you seriously asking me that right now?

This past weekend(Sunday), we all gathered for my sons 4th birthday celebration and while he was opening presents my sister announced she was pregnant and I was livid! So when she said, ""Mommy and Daddy were so shocked,"" I responded, ""yeah, I bet they were. You guys are living in their basement."" I know that was an a-hole thing to say, but there it is. After the party, I sent her a text to say I was sorry that I said anything about their living arrangements and it wasn't any of my business. She never responded. Which is her right. I can say anything I want, but I have to deal with the consequences of saying anything.
Today (Thursday), she sends me and her sister in law and email asking us to collaborate to plan her a gender reveal, this is the first contact she has attempted to make since the incident. Now, I have no issue being the gender keeper and making sure the correct color gets to them, HOWEVER, I do not think I should have to plan, execute and pay for HER gender reveal. I have two kids and at no point did I ever think to ask someone else to do the heavy lifting to reveal my kids gender. I am more than happy to plan her a baby shower, but this should be on her. Plus, the way she went about asking is just so entitled. I don't feel like she asked me to plan it. She asked me to collaborate. There was no opportunity to say no and if it's not what she wanted I'm the bad guy again.",,t3_1grja3o,AITA

I (40F) have two younger sisters, and we all live close to each other and our parents. We had a tough childhood with absent parents, which has affected us differently as adults. My sisters rely heavily on each other and our mom, while I lean on my partner for support.
About five months ago, my middle sister and I had a falling out because I chose a different realtor to buy a house after she quit real estate. She became extremely upset, called me names, and fabricated a contract to disrupt my new realtor's work. Despite my apologies and explanations, she blocked me and cut off contact between our kids. She also demanded my parents cut off contact with me due to perceived “favoritism”. Youngest sister took her side without even hearing me out and is adding to the drama.

Anteatereatingant,AITA for telling my friend she can get back in touch when she stops being perpetually busy?,2024-11-14T09:22:30.912000+0000,5578,1203,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gr10pe/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_can_get_back_in/,"So, long story short: I've had it with one of my friends. We've known each other for about 12 years (met at uni, now we're mid-30s). She's the ""permanently busy"" type - if you know, you know. Always doing something, can't be alone with her thoughts for one second, hyper-extroverted, etc.
She's a nice person but that pattern of compulsive ""busy-ness"" got on my nerves from the start. Like...after we graduated she worked part-time. That's it. For extra money she let out the other three bedrooms in her house. No kids, no dogs, no serious partners, no ailing relatives. And despite working maximum 2-3 days a week from 8 to 3, she was almost impossible to get a hold of. I lived 30 minutes away ON FOOT and we'd still see each other every 3-4 months at best. And every time, the spiel was ""I know it's been ages but I'm just so BUSY!"".
A few years ago I moved so we're now in different countries. I tried to stay in touch via WhatsApp but even that's been falling apart. Over the lockdown she got married and had two kids. So you can imagine how hard she is to get a hold of now that she actually has responsibilities and isn't just busy being busy.
So for the past year now our interactions have dwindled down to me sending her life updates and asking about hers...and her getting back weeks later if I'm lucky, months later or not at all if I'm not, with a generic ""so sorry, been so busy but you're in my thoughts, how are you x"". Meanwhile she's still pretty active on social media and regularly posting about all the fun things she gets up to with all those other people.
So to cut a long story short, I decided this means she's just not interested and trying to tell me nicely. I mean...how else am I supposed to take barely answering me, and if so mostly just to remind me for the millionth time of just how BUSY she is, while simultaneously showing off all the things and people she *does* miraculously find the time for?
Now here's the kicker. She messaged me about three months after my last message, once again with a generic ""so sorry, so busy, how are u xx"". And I chose not to respond because I'm over it. A month later (last week) it was my birthday, and she sent a birthday message and sounded quite upset I hadn't responded to the previous one.
I responded by telling her what I said in the title: ""What's the point of messaging you anyway, when I already know how it's gonna go? I'll pass. Let me know if you ever get less permanently busy and can keep in touch on a more substantial level than getting back to me months later just to remind me of how busy you are"".
I heard through the grapevine (mutual friends/acquaintances) that she's upset at how I talked to her. But I don't think I'm in the wrong here. Am I obligated to keep making an effort for someone who just can't or won't reciprocate? And FFS - isn't it bizarre to get upset when someone you clearly don't care enough about to make an effort to include in your life, lets go?

Jazzlike-Diamond-638,AITA for refusing to pay half for a new gate?,2024-11-14T21:31:33.480000+0000,505,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grfuvs/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_half_for_a_new_gate/,"Obligatory throw away and on phone.
About one year ago my fiance and I purchased some land in a newly developed area. All of the houses are less than 10 years old. Our land is down a long driveway. The driveway is shared with another piece of land next to us.
Both the previous owner of our land and the owner of the other empty property both intended to build houses but Covid happened and they ran out of money.
Unknown to us when we bought the land, they had both agreed to let all of the kids in the neighborhood use the land as a playground. They had also allowed the house between our property and the road to take down a section of the fence between their backyard and our driveway so they could get a trailer directly to their backyard.
The fence panels they removed still exist and are sitting in their backyard, leaning against the remainder of the fence.
We started building a house immediately after purchase and are almost finished. We're come to realize the gap in the fence is a major problem.
All of the neighborhood kids play together in their backyard (they have kids) and use the driveway as a shortcut to the empty section and friends houses. On multiple occasions we've had to slam on our breaks because a kid has run out of the gap, across our driveway. The driveway is a steep hill and it's not easy to stop quickly, especially trucks arriving with building supplies etc.
The gap also looks very messy. It's where they hide all of their rubbish etc they don't want seen from the front of their house but it is the front of OUR house. Garden waste, dirt etc slides off their section and onto pur driveway.
We told them we want to put the fence back up and that we would happily be the ones to do it. My husband is a builder and repairing a fence is a relatively easy job for him.
They replied that they agree because of the safety issue, which they claimed to be unaware of, but they intend to put a gate in so they can continue to get a trailer to their backyard. Initially we were against this but they made a good argument for themselves, promised to only use it a few times a year with advance permission and to always tidy up any mess. We reluctantly agreed.
Fast forward a few weeks and we get a message saying they have a quote for getting a gate installed. $700 and they expect us to pay half because it's a shared fence. We were shocked. We replied no and explained the gate is only benefiting them and that we should not have to pay for them to use our driveway. They replied that was an abrupt response and that we had told them we would happily help with the fence. I replied yes, with a fence, not a gate, and by help we meant my husband put back the original fence at no cost to anyone not fund a gate that only benefits them.
So AITA?

She doesn't have a great relationship with my family, and while everyone is polite and cordial when they meet, a lot of issues have happened in the past. My wife really doesn't want to deal with any more issues that might come up at the wedding. We have three kids and live in a different country.
I've asked my wife if it's okay for me to go for five days - pre-wedding plus the actual wedding, as I am the eldest and this is the last wedding in my family. My dad also passed a couple of years back, so I kind of have the mantle passed on as the lead of the family. She was not okay with this and said that she can maybe look after the kids for a couple of days but not more than that. we cannot get any support here as we dont have family and apart from school, the kids would be at home with the wife.
The five days have now come down to four - I can go for the two days of the actual wedding and then come back, but me being there for the four days would mean a lot to my mum. I asked my wife again, and she doesn't want to talk about it as she gets stressed when I bring my family up. I am feeling quite indecisive and frustrated as I cannot make a decision without hurting people in my life.
UPDATE: thanks for all the feedback. Some very useful comments and advice. to give more context, yes I am willing to take the kids even all 3 with me. However, my wife is not ok with that. My family and wife are on speaking and even visiting terms, however, my extended family - aunts, uncles and cousins - are not someone my wife wants to really bond with. They would be at the wedding which is a major reason my wife doesnt want to really go. None of the kids are special needs and yes my first 2 are independant and can help out. My wife is quite amazing and understanding in a lot of things but we always conflict when it comes to my family. I have been trying to be supportive of her but she is not willing to let go of past transgressions which was mostly fueled by my moms siblings and their kids which caused a lot of friction.
I should have stepped up more and supported her more which I am trying to do. I am ok for her to come with the kids and stay over at her parents while I go to the wedding but she is not ok with this as well coz it would further create problems with her family and mine as well.
sorry for not providing updates sooner. I will update once I make a final decision. I tried to have a conversation which turned into a fighting match with us not speaking in the end.",,t3_1grbupm,AITA

He told his manager and foreman that I had taken a bad fall putting up Christmas decorations. That is not all of it. When he called them this morning he continued his story telling them he had come home to me on the floor with plants and soil thrown everywhere from my fall, that I had hit the coffee table on my way down and that my knee and my ankle are swollen and he was going to be taking me in for x-rays. Here is the thing we work for the same company, I work from home on a couple of different project than him, but we know a lot of the same people from previous jobs.
He is telling me the story that way if anyone comes up to me at our upcoming Christmas party I can be prepared if they ask me how I'm feeling. I told him I thought this was seriously f*^%ked up. I told him I didn't like being used as an excuse so he can get off work early and I have been making smarty pants comments towards him. For example when he asked me if I was okay, I told him ""I'm not sure you tell me"" or he askes me to get him something and I tell him ""no, my knee is hurting I can't walk right now"" He told me he is getting sick of my smart a** comments and that he is over it. I told him I don't appreciate being used as an excuse and I don't appreciate someone ""wishing harm upon me"" he told me I was overreacting.
So AITAH for not wanting to be used as excuse....FYI this isn't the first time he has done this to me the last time he didn't tell me I was his excuse so when I was asked by an acquaintance if I was feeling better I told them I was never ill.

Whenever they are in an ""off again"" period, all they want to talk about is their relationships and the details of this most recent breakup.

They basically called me prudish and told me that sex and romance are ""facts of life"" and if I can't come to terms with that, I won't have any close friends. Now I'm worried that I really was being prudish or making them feel judged, that wasn't my intention at all, I'm just honestly at a loss as to why they want my advice on something that I have very little knowledge or interest in. I'm worried my other friends are going to feel the same way when they hear about this.
ETA: everyone in this friend group is queer and poly, so part of why I'm worried I did something wrong is because I know they've all been judged for that kind of thing before and I don't want to come across as homophobic or sex negative or whatever",,t3_1grwtvc,AITA
Full-of-Bread,"AITA for not using soap on a measuring spoon used for baking soda, salt, etc.?",2024-11-15T19:21:31.987000+0000,6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs4cpu/aita_for_not_using_soap_on_a_measuring_spoon_used/,"I (23) still live at home with my mom.
Recently, she was upset when she saw me measure out some baking soda with a measuring spoon, rinse it with water and no soap, and then place it with the clean dishes.
She berated me for being gross.
If I’d measured something liquid or sugary, I’d definitely use a bit of soap. When I measure out things like baking soda, baking powder, or salt, I give them a little rinse and call it sufficient.
I don’t just splash it with some water, I run it under the faucet (in jet mode) and make sure there is no residual powder left.
I do this because, often when baking or cooking, I use many dishes at the same time and make an effort to clean while I cook.
I also don’t do this if I’ve been handling raw meat, egg, etc., mostly when baking, and only when measuring out those few ingredients.
Am I just gross?
Edit: I also wash my hands frequently with soap while I cook/bake. I understand it wouldn’t be hard to use a little soap. Sometimes, there is just a mountain of dishes. The measuring spoons get washed after handling sugar, soy sauce, cinnamon, etc., just not after a little baking soda!",,t3_1gs4cpu,AITA
Intelligent_Cry2324,AITA for expressing concern about my friend’s sister’s future?,2024-11-15T19:17:06.166000+0000,4,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs492o/aita_for_expressing_concern_about_my_friends/,"Hi everyone! Throwaway account.
I (24M) went with my friend Mark (25M) from grad school to his hometown this past weekend.
For context, we’ve been friends for about a year, but I’d never met any of his family. He asked if I wanted to go down for a weekend to visit his mom and sister. I agreed.
So on the way there I ask what his family does and he tells me about his sister, Ellie. He tells me she’s 29, and lives with their divorced mother. I was thrown off by that alone.
Then I found out she doesn’t have a job. I asked him if she even had an education? Did she go to college? Nope. Apparently she went to community college for one quarter when she was 18, decided she didn’t like it and dropped out. Even crazier to me is that she hasn’t worked or had a job ever, nor has she ever even thought about going back to school.
He saw I looked a little concerned and then added that “She just has a few problems. It’s good she stays with my mom so she can take care of her.” I was a little taken aback by the idea of their mom “taking care of her” at this age, but I didn’t say anything.
So at the apartment me and Mark have a fun time and all, the mom is super sweet. But then I get introduced to Ellie, who is sitting on her chair playing video games. She’s borderline obese and generally looks super unhealthy. We talk for a minute and then she goes back to her game.
On the day we were leaving I was waiting for Mark in the living room, and Ellie was there too. Keep in mind I am slightly concerned that she’s been mooching off their mom for nearly a decade, and I’m concerned as to what will happen in ten years.
We start chatting and I ask if she’s ever thought about going back to school and/or ever getting a job. She then gets all upset and walks off angrily. That was the last I saw of her, Mark and I left soon after.
So then I get a text from Mark on Monday asking me what I was thinking, saying that Ellie had told him all about how I’d “tried to control her”. I called him and tried to explain that literally wasn’t the case at all. I told him that quite frankly her situation is concerning and he and his mom don’t seem to care at all about her future.
He got mad and hung up.
Can someone please tell me I’m not crazy for being concerned? Or if I am in the wrong please explain why? Genuinely her two family members don’t seem to have her best interest at heart. I really wasn’t trying to start conflict.

Here’s the thing: she’s a trained actress and singer who’s always auditioning for roles in musical theater, and my apartment is not big enough for her to practice her singing – and I’m talking about full on belting, it’s REALLY loud, like songs from Wicked – without distracting me completely or interfering when I’m on a call (I work from home).
I asked her if she could find somewhere else to practice, and said that when we look for our next place we’ll make sure it can accommodate both of our needs. She got mad because I knew she had to practice her singing (it’s true, I did, but I didn’t think it would interfere so much until after she moved in), and said that if I’m the one uncomfortable, I’m the one who should find a co-working somewhere.

missloveylovett,AITA for letting my roommate know that I feel obligated to care for his dog?,2024-11-15T15:16:29.366000+0000,10,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gryldw/aita_for_letting_my_roommate_know_that_i_feel/,"TLDR; AITA for feeling obligated to do my roommate's dog chores, and trying to set a boundary about it?
My roommate, (G), moved in with me, (P), a few months ago, and brought his golden retriever. I am fine with this arrangement. I love dogs, and my roommate and I get along on all fronts.
The dog sleeps in a crate each night, which I do not have a problem with, and usually is put in at 8-9pm.
Consistently, I wake up earlier than G does, and when I wake up, 7-8am, I find it rude to not take the dog out to at least pee. He's been waiting for 10-12hrs to pee. And I find it sad if I put him back in the crate right after, because he needs to stretch his legs.
So daily, I feel an obligation to care for this dog's social needs in the morning if I'm the first one he sees. Filling up the water bowl. Feeding. Throwing a ball. Petting. Which usually amounts to about 1hr or less of time outside the crate before I have to leave for work. Sometimes, I am even late to work, because I have my own morning routine (getting dressed, breakfast).
My roommate has been more frequently emerging from his room after I have done all of these dog chores. And immediately leaving for work. Once a week, he will wake up earlier than me and take the dog for a long walk, (~20mins).
This morning, G and I exchanged good mornings, and I said I wanted to bring something to his attention...so I said ""I fear I may be starting to feel resentment about doing doggy chores in the morning, or feel like there's a mild expectation that I take care of these things because I see him first in the morning before you do.""
The vibe got defensive from him. I might not have been worded the best. I just needed to say something because I don't want this to bubble into a larger issue.
He said ""what, do you want me to get up earlier or something? You don't have to do these things. He doesn't need to be taken out for a walk in the mornings, that's just something I do if I feel like it.""
I said ""I am starting to feel bad, it's taking a toll on me, it feels like a burden to wake up earlier than you do, I don't want to just ignore the dog, he needs to go out. I didn't take him out to poop this morning either because I need to leave soon.""
He got quiet and said ""yeah, that's fine. Don't do these things if you don't want to. He's fine. I have a meeting. Got to go."" Then he left for work.
If I hadn't filled up the dog's water, food, and took him out to pee, it wouldn't've happened today :( back into the crate from 8am - 5pm. Yesterday, I got home at 5, and G at 8.
He's crated for 9hrs during work minimum, out for 4hr max, crated overnight for 10hrs, then gets let out by me for up to 1hr. A golden retriever, with a lot of energy.
I may be the asshole because I sprung it on my roommate before his meeting without warning or asking for a sit-down talk about it. AITA for trying to set a boundary based on how my roommate's actions towards his dog affects my mental health and morning/evening schedules?",,t3_1gryldw,AITA

I took some pictures of her and made a Facebook post to see if anyone knew whose cat she was. I then left a bowl of water and some cat food on the porch for her and a little box with a blanket in it for her to sleep in if she wanted. And I went inside.
Later that night, I saw the same cat nearly get hit by a car, so I decided to call my landlady and see if she knew of the people next door having a cat that may have gotten out. There are several people that live in the house next to me but only one of them speaks English so I could have gone over there myself, but usually when I try to communicate with them it does not get me very far. My landlady said she did not know of them having a cat but she would ask.
The next day, I was about to take this cat to a vet clinic to have her checked for a microchip and I get a text from the landlady saying that it is in fact the neighbor's cat. Apparently, they had visitors who had a dog with them and because the cat and the dog didn't get along, their solution to that was to put their previously indoor-only cat outside. Supposedly the visitors were leaving that night and she would be back inside.
Around 8:30pm that night, the cat was still on my doorstep, crying to be let in. It was also like 35 degrees outside. With my neighbors nowhere in sight, I scooped her up and brought her inside. I informed my landlady that I had done this and that they can come knock on my door if they want me to give her back. That was 3 days ago and the cat is still with me.
Since she's been in my care I have discovered that she has fleas, is sneezing and congested, and has a significantly fractured Canine tooth. I gave her one of my cat's Nexgards for the fleas for now, but she needs more extensive care than that. I also have no idea if she is spayed, vaccinated, etc. If she is still with me by the weekend I am going to make her a vet appointment because she needs one. But if I pay a vet bill, I am keeping this cat. Does that make me the asshole?",,t3_1gr5h2o,AITA

My mum never really praises me she instead picks at bits I could do better. My teachers have definitely noticed this and try to give me praise for my efforts. Last week I decided I wasn't going to apply to one of my university options as it is expensive, too far from home and the nightlife is not great. When I told my mum this and shared my wishes to apply to other equally respected unis, that are better fits but not quite as good for my specific subject she said 'I will have to think'. I then proceeded to tell her it was my choice not her decision. She then stated that if I wanted living money to get through university she had influence and stated I had threatened her aggressively in saying it was my choice, seeming like I don't appreciate her opinion. She then went on to state my degree is all about the quality of the uni because it won't get me a job. I find all this very insulting and while I am grateful to be offered money for support through my education I think If I am applying to a decent uni, it should be my choice where I decide as I have to live there for three years. So, AITA? Update- I have apoligised to her about possibly coming across aggressive and it is not just the night life that makes me not like that uni- it is not suited to my needs. I would also like to clarify I am not asking or expecting her to pay, she has decided herself to give me money. I am quite happy to get a student loan and work whilst at university.

In January 2021 I (f39) got covid from said best friend (f39) and I spread it to my family and friend in another town when me and other friend were looking for a house to move into. mom didn't make it, and I left to this other town 2 weeks early because I couldn't be there without my mom. Best friend and I grew apart after this. I kind of abandoned everyone there and have since apologized.
In September, made the choice to go back to home town and see family and visit mom's grave for the first time since she died. Around the time this happened, best friend let me know she was going to be in my new town with another friend of ours for the day and wanted to visit. I was excited. we had an amazing visit. It's been weird between us for years now, but this felt like old times.
while she was here i told her about upcoming trip. Said it was an overnight trip where I would get there early Friday and leave Saturday afternoon. I said I wanted to visit her, but it would be very quick because I'm sure I'd be drained after the cemetery. She said she understood. Also, I needed to get a few things from her.
I let her know I was there and me and my sister and her kids were at the bnb. They had a falling out, so I knew BFF wouldn't want to visit there. I message her day of and let her know I was going to come early because I got scared and didn't go to the grave the day before so I was going to have my sister still and wanted to go see her before check out time. She tells me she's not home, but can ship my stuff. Shed told me she would be home all day, and I reminded her again it'd be short and she was OK with it. she was pissed and I could tell. So I went to see my mama. It was beautiful and sad.
The next day, she messaged me, saying she was heartbroken that my first time back, I was only going to visit for 20 min. She said even though that's what I'd told her, she couldn't believe I meant it after she's visited me multiple times. She sees where I've prioritized our friendship now. I took a couple days to reply. It was very respectful. I said I understood why she was upset and proceeded to tell her that's why I made sure to say a short visit. I was there to see my sister, the kids, and my mama, and that's what I did. That going home brought up so much traumatic shit and I needed to leave as soon as I could. It had nothing to do with her and that I planned to go again around my bday and would love to spend a couple hours with her.
She replied 2 weeks later, and all she said was shed spent the last two weeks tweaking a message shed typed out, but all she could come up with was, ""idk what to say to this."" Idk what to say back, and now I'll feel like an asshole to ask her to please ship me my stuff. Don't know what to do from here but it is what it is. Did I mess up??",,t3_1gs47ma,AITA

I needed to have someone stay and help me over those first 8 weeks so I rented a large house on the water with a pool. I wanted those who came to help me to have an enjoyable environment. Friends and family offered to help and a schedule was made. Basically, people made it a vacation and met my needs while enjoying the amenities. My late husbands sister was the first to take advantage of the great set up. She stayed a week. She arrived while I was still in the hospital and then hustled out as fast as possible and left the day I was discharged. She didn't bother to visit me while in the hospital as she didn't like the traffic. Effectively doing nothing for me but enjoying the beautiful home and amenities. Prior to the surgery I let her know that I was leaving $1,000.00 in the home to be used exclusively for items needed for the house, paper and laundry products and cleaning supplies. Also, any needs for my dog who would be at the house when I was discharged. Imagine my shock when I discovered she spent all of the $$ in six short days. Hurt and feeling used I decided to table the issue til I was feeling better. As I was recovering I was not texting or answering calls, phone was off. I needed all of my energy for my literal survival. There was no consideration for what I was going thru and thus no communication from me.
Weeks later her husband made a feeble attempt to admonish me for not texting and calling her ""to make her feel better."" Sorry, not sorry was my response to this entitled one.
Nearly three months later I was back home and she came to visit. After a pleasant visit I asked what made her think that it was okay to spend all of the money I had left for use at the house.
She said she had given me receipts for her expenses. That is true. She began ""charging"" me before she left home. Body wash, breakfast, chewing gum. Then she stated she used it to stock up the kitchen. I asked for whom? Since it was bits of left overs, for whom was she leaving these. She had several notes stating she used her own credit card and no receipt available, listing food and gas (she has an electric car). Then she stated that I had gifted it to her. I reminded her that I had not and my instructions. Then she stated it was her expense account. I asked why she thought she was entitled to an expense account and what made her think I would provide one. When I originally rented the house she shared that she had been bragging to friends about her wonderful vacation planned at my summer rental.

Weary_Young_5982,"AITA for not reporting a colleague's toxic behaviour earlier, which led to a major fallout and me leaving my job?",2024-11-15T21:25:53.358000+0000,1,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs75qh/aita_for_not_reporting_a_colleagues_toxic/,"Back in December 2023, a new teacher joined my school. Let’s call him ""GT."" I already knew him because we had matched on dating apps in June 2023, though we never chatted much. By August, I had started dating a female colleague, so I uninstalled the apps. When GT joined the school, we quickly became friends, partly because we were both queer (GT is gay, and I’m bi), though we kept this private due to the stigma in our area.
Here’s where the drama began. Another teacher, ""ET"" (a closeted bisexual with a girlfriend), started hitting on GT. I pointed it out to GT, but he shrugged it off. Later, GT told me that on Christmas (his birthday), he and ET hooked up, even though ET had a girlfriend (let’s call her GF). GT was conflicted, so I advised him to step away from ET if he wasn’t comfortable being the ""other man."" He ignored this advice, kept hooking up with ET, and even started befriending GF.
Eventually, GT decided to break things off with ET but also asked me out. I declined after realizing he was only trying to make ET jealous. GT even stood me up for a date, which solidified my decision to distance myself. He later confessed everything about his relationship with ET to GF, outing ET in the process. This didn’t sit right with me because I believe no one has the right to out someone else. GT justified it as ""helping"" GF, but I was concerned about ET’s mental health.
As things escalated, GT began showing toxic behaviour. He invited me over, kissed me while drunk, and later implied that I was at fault. I apologized to avoid further drama, but it didn’t end there. GT started spreading rumours about me at school, telling people I was gay (not bi) and accusing me of inappropriate behaviour. He framed me as the villain in his mess with ET, even though I had tried to help both of them.
Eventually, the school politics got involved, and GT gained support while my reputation took a hit. I reported his behaviour to management, but by then, the damage was done. Students were aware of the drama, and GT and ET even fought in front of them. I decided to leave the school because I couldn’t take the environment anymore.
Now, looking back, I wonder if I’m the AH for not reporting GT’s behaviour earlier when I first saw the red flags. Maybe if I had spoken up, the situation wouldn’t have spiraled into such chaos.
So, AITA for waiting too long to take action?",,t3_1gs75qh,AITA

When my husband (35m) and I (34f) found out we are pregnant on my first my inlaws had gotten worse when it comes to crossing my boundaries, passive aggressive comments, etc.
Bottom line is… I am not good enough for their son/brother.
My husband throughout these years is getting better on understanding me and started hearing the digs my inlaws would make towards me and actually find it offensive, however, we still have a long road ahead of us.
It is helping that my inlaws live 4 hours away from us.
My inlaws asked my husband one day on what day we are available for baby shower.
I told my husband, I do not want a baby shower.
I find it boring, and they want to do it on tax season which is the busiest and stressful season of the year for me. They also want it to do it to my MIL’s house because my husband’s family live around the area.
Pregnant, stress, tired. So no to baby shower.
So my inlaws decided that they throw a baby shower for my husband.
Well, we did not attend for obvious reason. My husband however felt so disrespected that he refused even the gifts. So my MIL had to return the gifts.

About a month ago R started calling me it sometimes in a sarcastic way and sometimes not. I've told him not to call me that before but I guess he didn't hear me.
I've told him off before for overstepping his place in my life and my mom has gotten pissed at me everytime. My dad agrees with me most of the time about it when I tell him.

ThrowRA_38519,AITA for making my boyfriend worry by just disappearing?,2024-11-15T23:33:56.301000+0000,46,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs9zgc/aita_for_making_my_boyfriend_worry_by_just/,"I (20F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together for almost two years. He’s the sweetest guy I know. Well… was. He got a new job about 2 months back and quickly made some new friends. He would hang out with them EVERY night after work drinking, clubbing and partying (even though we had an agreement before all this that we’d never go clubbing without the other person present).
All in all, he’s turned into someone I barely recognise. He doesn’t apologise, or see things from my perspective. When I message him when he’s out, he gets annoyed and tells me I’m being dramatic or just ignores me altogether. I’ve spent many sleepless nights crying and worrying about him because he wouldn’t text, or his phone would die / location would be turned off.
Before you guys comment the obvious (cheating). That thought has crossed my mind. And I’m not totally ruling it out right now.
Last month, he did the worst thing yet. He went out with his friends as usual and he ended up sleeping in a hotel (no idea where or which one), with his phone dead, didn’t text me for a whole night and skulked back in at 11 in the morning the next day. I hadn’t slept a wink from worrying and instead of apologising, he started trying to justify himself and telling me if I had friends (ouch) I would do the same thing (I absolutely wouldn’t. I respect him enough to communicate my whereabouts.)
I told him after this that I’ll forgive him this one time. But if he ever did it again, I will not stay with him. He accepted, and said it wouldn’t happen again; or at least he’d tell me.
Anyway… it’s 11:30pm right now and guess who’s not home! Guess who’s out clubbing! Guess who’s not responding (putting down my calls) Guess who’s having a good time whilst his girlfriend sat in bed crying, worrying and shaking. (He also knows I have really bad diagnosed anxiety).
Yes I am planning to break up with him. And im never petty, but tonight just brought something over me. I booked a hotel, at literally 10:45, and Ubered there. I checked in and now, when he gets home, I won’t be there. My bags are packed at the bedroom door (to add bonus mystery) and tomorrow I will go and collect them and leave without saying a word. I feel like this is mean of me, but I just want so badly to give him a taste of his medicine. (He will worry. He doesn’t like me going out but for some reason he’s allowed to do it and I can’t complain).
Anyway. Would you say I’m TA for doing this? Is it childish?",,t3_1gs9zgc,AITA

After I sat down I made acquaintances with the person who was sitting beside me. At some point, they went to the food cart to have lunch. In the meantime, the train stopped at a station and a black man (I mention the color as it becomes relevant later) got on and took seat beside me. For context, Amtrack doesn't have assigned seat and passengers are free to seat at any empty seat available.
I don't really care who sits beside me, but by now I had built up a good rapport with my co-passenger. So, I politely told the new guy that someone was already sitting there. He asked if I knew them and I said no. He got angry and told me it's none of my business then. A conductor noticed the commotion and came up. The black man immediately accused me of being racist and not wanting to sit by a black person. I explained the situation and the conductor agreed (they have markers to see the destinations for each seat, so they knew I was telling the truth) and asked him to move.
At this point refused to move and threw a tantrum saying how he gets discriminated everyone. At this point, the conductor called for security and finally the guy moved saying the world is against black people.
I simply politely told the guy that the seat was taken and did not want things to escalate so far. If nobody was sitting beside me already I would have no issues with him sitting beside me. I try to treat everyone fair and equal and didn't like being called racist.
So, AITA? Was there anything I could do better to avoid the situation. Should I have simply kept quiet and let the other guy deal with it?",,t3_1gs6jbc,AITA

I ,myself, thought that it’s a little too early to start transitioning, but I didn’t say anything and decided to be supportive. After all, that’s my child!
Anyway, a few days ago, my son saw me scrolling through my camera roll and yelled at me because I was tearing up at his baby pictures, where he was still dressed extremely femininely and was obviously a girl. I wasn’t crying at it because he isn’t a girl anymore, I was crying because time flies! He told me that by me keeping those photos as memories, I am totally disregarding the fact that he is no longer a girl and I am transgender phobic.
INFO: At the time I was looking at the pictures, my son wasn’t near. I would never look at those around him because that’s a big boundary of his.
My heart was saddened by this because that is the last thing I will ever be. I have open arms to anyone and everyone.
I personally believe that it’s not fair for me to delete the photos because those are some of the only memories I have of him when he was an infant/kid. Please give me some feedback if i’m the asshole or not, and whether I should delete them.",,t3_1gs9x9a,AITA

I reacted by saying 'oh but it said 13.99 on the shelf' but gave her a 20, because well mistakes happen. She said let's go check it out, but I said it's ok, no worries. She said no, picked up the product and went to check. She saw it's 13.99 came back and told me to wait. She was gone for a few minutes after that and when she came back she was visibly upset and told me in a voice that was on the verge of tears 'I guess we will gift you this'. I was very confused and thought I didn't hear her right, or she will just match the price on the tag with a discount, but no I was given the product and a receipt for 0.01.

Swanknebula6922,AITA for arguing with my family over my young cousins funeral Eulogy?,2024-11-15T21:18:41.582000+0000,10,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs6zzc/aita_for_arguing_with_my_family_over_my_young/,"So for more context, my sister is a trans female and has started her transition over half a year ago now. Everyone in my family always says how supportive they are but I’m not so sure to what extent anymore.
Recently my 18yo cousin passed away in a suddenly in a car accident, which of course is incredibly devastating for the entire family but luckily enough we have had the rally around us and especially her Mum, Dad and older brother.
Her funeral tomorrow and my Mum has been asked to write the eulogy. She read it out to me and it was absolutely beautiful but I had noticed one thing wrong with it. When mentioned all of the family, my sister got deadnamed. (I also should add her name is even legally changed on everything now). I naturally asked her why that was the name written down and she said it was at request of my aunty and uncle. It is apparently because my cousin always knew her as ‘deadname’ so they want everyone to call her that on the day. Also because they don’t want everyone asking questions about ‘who is (new name)’ and things like that on the day since not every single person in the family knows about her transition.
I personally don’t think it would be a problem, there are 13 cousins to be mentioned on both sides of her family, and my sisters name will be right bang in the middle. I don’t think at the end of a Eulogy on my 18yo cousins funeral people are going to pick apart the eulogy and go oh who’s ’new name’ and where’s ‘deadname’.
My sister wasn’t aware of this situation yet so I went and told her and she was as upset as I was as I assumed she would be, so she went over the next day with my Mum to just respectfully go and have a quick chat/politely ask to change the name to her new name. In my opinion it didn’t go well, it was respectful and everything, no fights or arguments. But they just flat out said no to the ‘new name’ and gave the other excuses from before. They also be said no to a compromise which was my sisters deadname/new name. They also said no to that.
So in the end the plan is my Mum is going to pretend to stutter and half way through the deadname, her current name will be said. In my opinion this is even worse now. Now the door is opened for actual questions about it. But thats the closest they could get.
I was fuming about this and people who before had been previously ‘supportive’ like my Nan, cousin and whoever else are all on their side. My Nan said (Aunty and Uncle also bought this up) it’s ‘cousin who passed aways day’ and not ‘new names’ day.
I think it’s the ultimate disrespect to use someone’s deadname.
It shows how people truly feel, trying to hide it away.
Anyway anyone that reads this/responds Thankyou very much for doing so. I just wrote this as a rant I had to get off my chest since I don’t feel like I’m being heard out in this situation. I have probably missed details, so if anyone has any questions I’ll happily give context and answer them.",,t3_1gs6zzc,AITA

Despite her teachers' repeated attempts to intervene and get her support services, my aunt and uncle refused to have her evaluated. As a result, she is not very smart, has very poor social skills, and makes very bad decisions. She has a bad habit of talking to men on the internet, sending them money, nude pictures, etc., and wound up pregnant at one point, but thankfully miscarried.
My cousin's mom died when my cousin was in her early 20s, and her dad died in early 2023. Prior to my uncle's death, my sister offered to become her legal guardian, to help her with her finances and daily living.
My cousin openly defied my sister, continued to give money to strangers, befriended a very toxic neighbor, and made false claims to Adult Protective Services against my family. My sister finally had enough and we found a court-appointed legal guardian to manage my cousin's affairs. We settled my uncle's estate, sold his house, moved my cousin into an apartment, and placed her inheritance in a trust.
My cousin flipped out, demanding the money from the trust, and continued to make false claims to APS. Eventually she stopped talking to us, though we still kept in touch with her legal guardian.
After 18 months of silence, my mom sent my cousin a birthday card with $50, and suddenly she is back in our lives. My mom is thrilled, as she feels sorry for my cousin, but the rest of our family is less enthusiastic. My cousin is coming to my parents' house for Thanksgiving, but my sister made it clear that my cousin is not welcome at my sister's house for Christmas.
Today, my mom was talking about the upcoming holidays, and mentioned several activities she wants to do with my cousin, including going to a movie with her on Christmas Day. I said that I would probably pass on the movie. My mom expressed disappointment that I don't want to interact with my cousin, and I said if my mom wants a relationship with my cousin that I wouldn't stop her, but that I don't trust her and never will. My mom said my cousin hasn't done anything to me, and while I agreed, she has caused nothing but chaos for our family.
My mom asked if I would ""work on this,"" and I said I would think about it, but I'm not just going to jump back in with both feet. I said that my cousin and I have never been close, and these past 18 months have shown me just how manipulative and deceitful she can be. I love my mom more than anything, but I think my cousin is a dangerous mix of stupid and spiteful, and I don't want a relationship with her. AITA?",,t3_1gsafwx,AITA

My family is tearing me apart, and I’m starting to feel like I don’t even belong anywhere. I need to know if I was in the wrong here because I'm genuinely losing it.
A while ago, my friend was supposed to stay at her aunt’s, but her aunt was out of town. Dorms close at 7 PM, and it was 6:55, so I called my mom and asked if my friend could stay with us. She agreed at first but then called back saying no and that I should just give her money to leave, which didn’t make sense. I knew my aunts, (who live with my mom after she had a stroke to take care of her),pressured her into changing her mind.
I couldn’t leave my friend stranded, so I refused to go home without her. We stayed with another friend. The next day, my dad (parents are divorced) called me furious because one of my aunts complained to her husband, who called my dad to yell at me. My dad picked me up, and I spent the ride being humiliated. When I got to my mom’s, one aunt wouldn’t let me inside, saying, “Go back to where you came from.” I had to wait outside for an hour before they let me in.
Once I got in, my mom “talked” to me, which was more humiliation. Now, my parents (especially my dad) are calling me every day, which has never happened before. Today, I was studying when my dad called again, saying my aunt’s husband called him to complain. I told him I was studying, but later, he called back and started yelling, saying he was going to block me. I lost it and told my mom to tell her sister to stop calling him. My aunt (the one who hates methe most) yelled at me for speaking up and told me to stop because my mom is sick.
I snapped and told her to shut up. I overheard her later telling my other aunt that I made everything up to manipulate my mom. I called my dad to prove I wasn’t lying, and while he admitted the call happened, he turned it back on me, saying it was because I “tried running away.” My aunt laughed at my humiliation.
Now I'm going insane. They’re blaming me for everything, even saying I’m the reason my mom got sick. I’ve been isolating myself because I feel like a burden to everyone, including my friends. I feel like the worst person in the world.

For context, I haven't seen my daughters for nearly 3 years due to an ongoing custody case but I still have a load of their cuddly toys etc here. My wife (not the children's mum) has said i should throw it all away as it's a waste having it here and as we're moving, it's supposed to be a fresh start (we've had other issues this year) and not taking stuff to clutter up the new house. I said I'd take this particular bag of cuddly toys to the contact centre and see if my daughter wanted them (I have 2 daughters but the eldest one is refusing to see or speak to me due to what she's been told by numerous people on her mothers side) so I did take them and my youngest daughter is a bit challenging, she's autistic and while she said she did want to see me, she spends the entire session saying she doesn't so she refused the bag. I brought it back and tonight I got asked why I hadn't taken it on Sunday. I explained I had but she'd refused them and then got told I should throw them out as it's a waste having them in the house when they aren't being used and we can just get new ones if she's still into them when I get full access back.
I tried to say that it's not that easy because I form emotional and sentimental connections with things, so throwing them out, to me, feels like I'm ridding myself of my daughters. My wife tried to say that I'm making myself worse mentally by keeping them and that it's bad for her mentally as since we've been together, she's been told she can't have kids and she always wanted some so to have these things around the house not being used is having an effect on her but she doesn't seem to understand that it actually physically hurts to think about throwing them away so AITA for wanting to keep them?",,t3_1gs6zq8,AITA

I had to quit my job about 4 months ago due to an illness that had me in and out of the hospital. This illness causes high heart rate and low stanima.
Now my only job is keeping the house neat and making food for my very busy husband.
I have been doing as much as I can in my condition but haven't been able to stay on top of all the cleaning. I have been prioritizing things that my husband doesn't see as a priority and this makes him mad.
Because of this we have had many arguments about the housework. (I have been chalking it up to him being overwhelmed and not understanding my condition)
Well a couple days ago he comes downstairs telling me that we have been using to much TP. It had just been my week so I was using more than usual. I explained that to him and he said durring that week it's fine but otherwise I should only use 2 squares.
When I didn't agree right away he started to get upset so I just agreed to keep the peace.
Today he had the day off so we spent it out together.
When we went home I dropped him off and went to the grocery store and when I got back he was angry because the dishes weren't done.
We argued about it for a bit and he ended up calling me lazy. I left the room to cool down After about an hour he came to apologize for calling me lazy and we talked things out.
Things were going well so I decided to bring up the TP. I told him I felt like he was micromanaging and TP isn't a big expense so it was all very unreasonable.
He got angry and started going on about how I use too much and 2 squares is all I need. I tried to correct him and say maybe it's all he needs but I am a woman while he is a man but that just made him angrier and he yelled that its all anybody needs before slamming the door and leaving.
I'm still not certain that he is actually mad about the TP since it seems absurd to me, but maybe I'm missing the point?
Is he just angry because of his stress levels or is using more than 2 squares of TP really a terrible crime?

On one hand I see the frustration but on the other hand, we’re busy, the guys are slammed and my ticket times still aren’t even at 12 minutes. At the end of his shift one of the other servers was telling him what side work was his and he just lost it. He was being super rude, short and confrontational after that. Come to find out he didn’t do something right and another server asked “Hey A can you refill the ice for the morning crew?” And A started following the server around trying to argue with him and getting loud. Eventually I yelled at both of them to separate before I fire em both cause you could definitely hear them arguing from the lobby!
The situation progresses to A saying “I’m not doing my work what’s Mari (my wife) gunna do about it anyway, which is honestly where I get really fucking mad! Don’t go disrespecting my wife cause you’re not getting your way!
Anyway at the end of the night he pops in the office and says “hey I squashed the beef with the servers we good?” And my wife sent him home and told him he needed to cool off. Credit where credit is due he did call my wife and apologized to her, and being disrespectful on her shift.
The next time he saw me he was super confrontational and just said “what you don’t wanna talk to me anymore?!” I just looked over in the line and told him “I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to deal with the fact that I’m essentially mad at you for throwing a fit and not owning up to it”
I haven’t spoken to him about anything that isn’t for work since, and I feel like an asshole for not trying to fix this cause he was my friend before all this happened, but I also feel like he shouldn’t just expect me to get over it! He was rude and disrespected, me, my line, my wife and our staff!

The medical issue occurs quite often and she's pretty burned out about it so I often playfully tease her to get her to feel better and eat something.
He overhead me and got upset and told his sister to pass the phone and proceeded to berate me for not joking at a time like this as it's a medical emergency. I understood he was trying to protect his sister so I tried to reason with him but he refused to hear what I had to say and kept screaming for me to ""shut the fuck up"" and that I was acting like his kids.
After understanding that he was not willing to hear me out I said my goodbyes and passed the phone back to my GF, she calmed him down and explained that she appreciate the playfulness and that I do help when things are bad. Both she and his wife calmed him down and from what I heard from my girlfriend he admitted to overstepped due to grief as their elder brother died due to the same illness a year prior.
I asked my GF multiple times after the situation if I play around too much or was their more I can do to help her and she had no issues with my behavior and was confused why her brother was acting like that.
I understand where he was coming from but I'm having a hard time letting go of the way I was talked to, I even asked him while he was screaming at me how does he want me to be more helpful but he kept screaming that I should just shut up and help.
My GF would prefer that we be on good terms as she speak with him on a daily basis, and I know he was dealing with a lot of emotions in that moment so WIBTA if I hold a grudge and/or wait for an apology?",,t3_1gsa8d4,AITA

AveriNova,AITA for trying to get my mum to let me be more independent,2024-11-15T20:16:26.306000+0000,5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs5ll3/aita_for_trying_to_get_my_mum_to_let_me_be_more/,"I (21F) have graduated University and am back living with my family while I work in the area. I haven’t moved out yet as my house is in a good location (outskirts of London) for the industry I work in, and I don’t currently have the funds to rent anywhere of my own. Now I love my mum with all my heart but she has a really bad habit of being overprotective, I mean if I’m out anywhere she texts me no less than 5 times every hour and if it’s even slightly dark out that drops to basically every 15 minutes, I can’t leave the house of my own accord I have to give her a million details and also ask at least 2 days in advance, and also, and what started this argument we had, I’m not even allowed to walk from the train back to my house after work.
For context, my house is exactly a 7 minute walk from the train station down a main road with plenty of street lamps and general public hustle and bustle. There has also never been any sort of crime around that area that would constitute being more wary than usual walking through it.
Despite all this, my mum insists on picking me up from the station every day and won’t take no for an answer, and this would be fine except her picking me up also constitutes at least 4 messages every 2 minutes asking where I am on my journey, which if I take longer than a minute or so to reply to I get spammed with more messages and in some cases a phone call.
I have lived alone at University for 3 years, being entirely independent, and I am fine, I’m still here, so I just don’t understand why she won’t let me be more independent at home. What makes it worse is I had a job in central London during Summer and Winter holidays when I was 19 and 20, and I’d be coming home in the dark much later than I do now and back then she didn’t bat an eyelid! Maybe 1 or 2 texts but I was free to make my own way home. I’m older now and have less freedom than when I lived under the same roof back then!
Now I have to admit I’m quite an emotional person and when I feel strongly enough about something it can be hard for me to express my feelings without letting a bit of anger and tears though. And that’s what happened today when she picked me up and I couldn’t take it anymore, I told her I didn’t need picking up and could walk home alone. My mum went on the defensive saying she’s doing me a favour but I insisted over and over that she didn’t need to. She went on to say that she isn’t stopping me from growing up by picking me up from work but I told her that that’s what it feels like. She just won’t listen to me and now she’s upset which has me racked with guilt about my outburst in the first place. I know she was just doing a nice thing but I had told her before that she didn’t need to, and I just exploded.
So is it me, is this a non issue that I’m turning into one for no reason? Am I the asshole?",,t3_1gs5ll3,AITA

About 90 percent of the time we have (or had) a great relationship, with common interests, inside jokes, etc. However, as time as gone on, our arguments have seemed to take a toll on me
For some backstory, my parents did not have a functional relationship growing up, usually my mom would start a conversation with my dad and he would walk out (they are now divorced). I know there’s a lot more to this than I was aware of growing up, but conflict in general is very tense for me, and I tend towards to avoidant side. I was in therapy and did a lot of work in my late 20s and thought I had made significant strides towards healthy communications in relationships, but now Im not too sure.
In the past week, I have been extremely avoidant, as it feels like any conversation that we have puts me on the brink of a panic attack, which is not something I have experienced before. As my mom lives close by, I have been spending time there and avoiding being with him but last night we had another argument and he called me out on this.
For the most part, our arguments feel very one sided – in that he will speak and any time I add a rebuttal, I will get spoken over. I try to use the “I feel….” Statements but these don’t seem to be productive. What has been sending me into a panic attack is replaying statements he has said during these arguments. I have tried bringing things up afterwards if they were hurtful, however these get said again in a later fight, with him then justifying why he said it in the first place. There have also been comments around me not liking sex or my past with other partners that replay in my mind, including when we are intimate.
I have a therapy appointment in the next few days where I plan to discuss this and get more clarity, but I am also wondering, AITA for being avoidant and hiding the fact that I was about to have a panic attack?",,t3_1gs7406,AITA

It’s been a painful ride for all of us and we’re grateful for any moment when she recognizes us.
My sister, however, is set on bringing her to town for Christmas. It’s a five hour drive to get her there from the nursing facility. She’s in a very lovely elderly home with excellent and highly trained staff looking after her. We make sure someone in the family visits her regularly (I have a big family).
My sister wants to take her from the facility to our grandmother’s cottage, which my sister now owns because before she was diagnosed with dementia, our grandmother gave it away to a near-stranger. Needless to say, this place is very special to us and we’ve built decades of cherished memories there.
I’ve spoken to a number of people with family who also have dementia (or Alzheimer’s). They’re pretty shocked that my sister wants to do this. Our grandmother is wheelchair-bound so it would require someone carrying her up the stairs and placing her in it. She’s incontinent and we’d have to be really be sure to clean and bathe her well. She’s so fragile and prone to minor injuries.
I made the point to my sister that there are people who have spent years in school and training to do these things. I also told her think it would be better for us to drive down to visit her but my sister doesn’t like that idea. (By the way, the cottage is a four hours’ drive for my sister, so it’s not laziness on her part. It’s sentimentality and love).

I moved to a different state a litte over a year ago, leaving my friends behind. In the summer, I visited them in my old town. I was staying with my best friend, M. I took a bike and visited my friend C and then spent time with M. On the last day of my visit, I had planned to see E. E is is known for being a bit insecure and clingy, especially with me. I had planned to bike over to her house at noon. We had texted about this plan and agreed on it. On that morning, I told M about my plan for the day.(She was also a friend of E) She asked if she could come too and I saw nothing wrong with that. The only problem was that M's family had plans for the afternoon and she had to be home by 12:30. I texted E that I was coming early and bringing M. (She did not respond.)
We arrived around 10:30 and knocked on the door. No answer. We waited on the porch and then E called me on the phone, crying. She was still asleep and was not ready. She said that I always change perfectly good plans and I'm not reliable. She also said that she was upset I had brought M and wanted us to have time together without anyone else. She wished that M hadn't come and wished I had come when I said I would. She said that I should just go away and come back at noon, without M. She hung up the phone. I told M what she said but left out the part where she was not wanted. M is an awesome friend and doesn't deserve that.
We sat on the porch for a couple minutes and then E's sister came out. She said that E was unconsolable and that I needed to apologize. I said okay. E finally came out and her sister slipped back into the house. E completely changed the subject and got upset at me for not staying in touch with her. (We hadn't called or texted a lot over the last year but I did make the effort to plan time for her into my busy trip) she was crying about this and how she had missed me so much, completely ignoring what she was talking about earlier. I apologized and we spend a couple hours there without anymore drama. When I had to leave, she cried and said that we had to stay in touch more and I promised I would. Neither one of us has contacted the other since.
She clearly has been struggling with my leaving and misses me a lot, but I don't feel the same. I made new friends and kept in touch with certain old ones. I've never really felt like she was a positive person for my life and have tried to move on from her. AITA for doing this?",,t3_1gs51c1,AITA

Anyway, after an exhausting day at college, I had arrived home, and lay down on my chair in order to finally relax after a stressful day. This is where my little brother comes running in waving his tablet around in pure excitement that he had gotten to a certain point in his game and wanted to show it off. I told him that that's pretty cool and all but I just want to rest currently, so he sat down right beside me. Apparently, the thing that he had been grinding for was a boss fight that he had continued to lose over and over again until finally asking if I could do it for him. I had told him that I wouldn't since I just got back from college, which had angered him. This in turn had him making sly comments like ""Doosh"" or ""Doing this is way more productive than slouching around"", which had begun to get on my nerves, so I told him to leave. He, of course, tried not to at first, so I raised my voice and once again told him to leave. This time he had finally complied, but not before smacking the back of my head while doing it.
After getting slapped, I had gotten up and went toward my mother's room where she had been working and told her what happened with my little brother. Not long after, he had showed up and tried to twist the story, saying that I had been shouting and that was the reason he lost. Thankfully, my mom had taken my side and punished him, but now he's calling me a snitch.
With this being said, am I the A-hole for not beating a boss in my brother's game for him?",,t3_1gs7pj4,AITA

Like taking her out, playing, physical touch, etc. She has never really watched her when we want to have occasional date nights or go on vacation. I have even offered to drop her off at her house but she always comes up with an excuse. My daughter left home at 18 for college and has always been very independent. She does her own thing, which I’m not mad at, but she seems so aloof when she’s around my wife and her sister. My wife also mentioned that she should spend more time over here and my daughter basically snapped. She said that she has her own life and career. That if she wanted to spend time with a kid, she would’ve had one of her own. I got onto her for speaking to her stepmother in a disrespectful manner. She laughed at us and left quickly after.

I wanted the least amount of people “in the waiting room” to make it less stressful for me. Where i went wrong is not asking the hospital staff to not give my room number to ppl at the reception, tbh i didnt think it was necessary, but even then my mom shared that information knowing i didnt want anyone else present. My c-section was scheduled for 1pm but was pushed to later that night due to an emergency. My maternal grand father (76M) and his girlfriend came unannounced around 2pm despite knowing they were not invited. In the moment i didnt make it a big deal but i was upset that they took away that last moment i had to relax before having a baby. They stayed a good portion of the waiting time but left when it was taking to long (thankfully). They came back a few times during our hospital stay, every time unannounced when it wasnt convinient (when i was able to take a nap, i was busy with the doc/nurses ect.) My grand father’s girlfriend then posted pictures of my baby on facebook before i got the chance to announced my birth to many ppl, i was deeply upset by that, i would’ve liked to post the first pictures of my first baby myself and annouce my birth to family and friends before a Facebook post. Especially since my mom posted about my pregnancy and announced the name of my baby on Facebook before i could, all without my consent. I feel like i got robbed of those exciting moments of a first pregnancy. When we got out of the hospital they continued to show up at our house unannounced. One time, they called while i was taking a nap, i didn’t answer because i was sleeping. They then came over and i told them calmly that it wasnt a good time. They got upset bcs they called ahead and i didn’t answer. I calmly explained that i was napping (napping is a luxury when you have a newborn and I sleep when i CAN), I also explained that it wasn’t personal i just want a heads up before they come over because some occasions dont call for visitors for exemple if im sleeping, the baby is fighting a nap , I already have ppl over or im not home and ect. My grand father got really sad because i didnt answer the phone, regardless of my explanation. Later on my mom called me because my grand father was angry that he didnt feel welcomed at my birth and at my house to visit the baby. I explained to her that he wasn’t welcomed at the birth and he is welcome if he calls ahead. I told her that when someone doesn’t answer the phone its not personal it means that the person is busy or not available. My grand father justified his actions and feelings by saying that he took care of me when i was a kid and bought me stuff for the baby (to the risk of sounding ungrateful he bought a lot of stuff we dont need and will never use, lot of things for a toddler and dropped everything off at 7pm the night before my c-section, i spent that night storing and organizing everything instead of having quality time with my partner.) I explained that i am allowed privacy and a heads up before visitors and that if he has a problem with that he can take back all the stuff he got us (tbh that would make it easier for me instead of packing everything and donating it) Since then, him and his girlfriend are acting like im whitholding the baby from them, like i am unreasonable and an asshole. Im only asking them to call before coming over and understand that i was sleeping the one time i didnt answer the phone. But “family should be welcomed at any time”. I still wish all of them would delete the Facebook posts and apologize but I feel that even tho reasonable that would be a stretch for them. I didnt have problems with anyone else regarding the baby and the birth. My grand father and I always had a great relationship but now he acts like hes not alowed to see my baby and is making calling me a way bigger deal than it is.

I used to have 3 outside dogs, all 3 were male great Pyrenees named (fake names for anonymity) Bullet, Ghost, and Zeus. They were our LGD (Livestock Guard Dogs and I loved them with my whole heart and when Ghost and his brother Zeus passed, we found out that they were poisoned. It broke my heart.
Bullet was given to someone we thought we could trust, only to not know what really happened to him. It broke my heart because I felt like my whole world had been shattered after they left this world. They were my babies, my best friends, and my protectors. Fast forward to now, I have a female great Pyrenees and Anatolian mix. I can't bring myself to get close to her for fear of the same feeling.
I have an inside black cat named (again, fake name) Salem. He healed my heart, has been there for me through alot, and made me change my outlook on things. I told my 20 year old SIL, my MIL (in her 40s) and FIL (in his late 40s) that I think it would be best for me to focus on my inside animal because I can ensure his health and safety better than I can the outside dogs.
They agree with me and they say that me getting close to every animal will only do me more harm than good. My husband yells at me claiming I'm selfish and I don't love anything but myself. He always thinks that animals are going to die, even in the most unlikely cases. He yells and screams and makes me feel horrible for not wanting to get close to her or the other dogs outside.
I told him that I shouldn't get close to her and that I think I should focus on my cat. I think I might be at fault here for not getting close to her.",,t3_1gsaq46,AITA

This is my (20F) first time posting here, so please excuse any formatting issues.
My 39-year-old stepdad is turning 40 tomorrow. I used to think we were on good terms but every time he is home (he is only home on weekends, usually, due to his job) he insults me outright or is passive-aggressive. Now, I am autistic and struggle with social cues so he may have disliked me for a long time and I just never noticed.
A few nights ago, I talked to my mother about my remote job and how annoying it is when I can't work due to internet/bug-related issues. My stepdad was drunk and budded in, saying, ""Well, how about you go outside and do physical labor?"" I laughed because I thought he was joking, but then he continued telling my mom, ""Something is seriously wrong with your child,"" and he kept going on about how I didn't want to work.
Mind you, I have a job, take care of the house, and my siblings, AND pay rent. Moving in wasn't even my idea. My working mom is left with 5 kids while he is at work, and she needed my help.
Well today, I was helping my mom outside at the place we are holding his surprise party. She was also showing me where to hang the decor as she would be keeping him occupied while I set up. My mom stepped on an ant hill unknowingly and was covered in bites before she even knew what happened. I knew we were out of bug bite cream (idk what to call it) so I picked a bunch of Wood Sorrel that was in the area so I could make a paste to help with the bites. I adore herbology and wanted to put my knowledge to use.
We went home and I immediately started working on the paste. While I was making it, she was telling my stepdad about the ants and he said, ""I'm sorry, I can't do anything to help you."" To which my mom replied, ""Oh, no worries. OP is making a salve or something."" I honestly thought he was going to be interested or something because he is also into foraging, but he said, ""Oh. So, she's wasting time then?"" and then sauntered off to go drink more in the garage.
I'm still going to set up the party just to help my mom, but I am seriously thinking about not attending and leaving once I am finished. I know he would probably wonder where I was and be confused if I wasn't there. So, Would I be the asshole?",,t3_1gs9rec,AITA

Last year, my wife threw a big surprise party for me. I am not a big birthday person. Didn’t complain - but saw it coming and didn’t really want it. Pretended to be surprised and had a good time regardless and appreciated her. However, it was way too expensive. I told her next year I don’t want to spend any money.
I’m more of a low key guy. Ordering in food and watching a movie would be ideal for me. She also does not make much money right now, so we really rely on my paycheck (she’s almost done law school). I really didn’t enjoy paying the credit card bill after last years party.
I will go all out for her. I enjoy gift giving and planning things. However, I just don’t want her to spend money on me. If I need something, I’ll just buy it.
Anyways, I find out she planned a whole day in the city 2 hours away at a fancy restaurant. This means I gotta drive two hours there and two hours back (she’s scared of driving in the city). She also bought expensive tickets to a show and a few gifts.
Am I an asshole for saying to cancel the whole thing? I prefaced weeks ago to not spend too much money on anything. We have two expensive trips coming (Italy for her graduation).",,t3_1gr0ejc,AITA
Cuts-Are-Everywhere,AITA for threatening my friend to leave them by himself?,2024-11-15T23:11:58.008000+0000,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs9im0/aita_for_threatening_my_friend_to_leave_them_by/,"Okay, so I know how this sounds. But please just give me a chance before you answer. (Censoring the ages as we are minors.) I (F/NB) Have a friend, Micheal (Bigender), who is a really sweet kid. He's super kind, but due to playing baseball for many years, has lost some of his hearing. He can still hear, but sometimes he speaks louder than socially accepted.
I was good with this, up until recently when he started saying embarrassing stuff in public, and not normal stuff, saying he's a 'sociopath' (He's not) and that he's gonna throw himself out of a bus, or that he's gonna steal from stores that we are inside, taking my Chromebook, screaming, trying to scare me, going underneath tables, taking my lunch bag and pretending he was just being silly etc. etc.
Here's the thing. Micheal knows I have social anxiety, to a very serious degree, and I've expressed before to him that his trying to embarrass me on purpose really bothers me. (He's said before that he knows he is embarrassing me because it makes him laugh.)
Now, yesterday, he was doing his normal shenanigans, but it was just getting on my nerves. Micheal has a very high-pitched singing voice and was singing annoying songs at school, surrounded by a bunch of kids who bullied me, and I could tell they were watching.
I lost my rag and told him ""If you don't stop I swear I'm just gonna leave."" He looked sad and quietly asked, ""Do you hate me?"" I immediately felt awful and apologized and told him that I didn't, it just bothered me when he is so loud, just to embarrass me. The bell rang, and I went off to my next class, but this has been eating away at me. So, AITA?

I (25) was invited with my girlfriend (25) to her friends Halloween party. The plan was to go to the party then to some bars in our city. It wasn’t a big party. It was a specific group. Probably 12 people including us.
The date of the Halloween party was Saturday, November 9th. I guess during the last 2 weekends, people were out of town or busy so, since they all wanted to be together, the party landed on November 9th. I thought this was incredibly stupid. I agreed to go but I told my girlfriend I wasn’t going to dress up. We had coordinating costumes for the last 2 weekends.
Party came and went. I had fun and everything went fine but she was passive aggressive toward me all night and still brings it up. She says I looked like a jerk in front of her friends and could have done it for her. I told her that maybe I would have if we were staying at the apartment all night but I wasn’t going to go out to bars on November 9th in a Halloween costume.

I try to brush it off, but it's getting more obvious.
She gets more things, spends more money when out without being reprimanded. My mom (45F) pays very little attention to her social life, while my friends are almost always a topic of conversation. She gets away with almost everything, and my mom even got mad at me for sending a meme she didn't understand (100% appropriate for her to see, nothing bad at all).
Recently, my mom took me and my friend to a theme park near our house (about an hour drive away). I've only been one time before with some family friends, and my sister has been about 5 times with her friends.
The whole time before we left to pick up my friend, my mom was telling me not to mention it to her. She knew we were going, but my mom didn't want her to be jealous. The times my sister went with her friends, she bragged about it a ton. To clarify, her friends invited her to go, not the other way around.
After I got back (we were gone for roughly 6 hours, but my sister had sports my dad took her to), my sister was upset she wasn't able to go. The park was closing for the season soon, and she wouldn't be able to go.
Now, my mom has been making plans to take her and someone because she got so jealous of me. I tried to talk to her about how it was unfair, and she had already been many more times than me, despite me liking roller coasters more. She told me that she was ""giving us equal opportunity"". I told her that if I were the one who was jealous, I would have to ""deal with jt"" because I'm older, and told her she clearly favors my sister. My mom blew up, and now my family is angry with me.

Anyways, there's this one girl, and I'll be calling her Anna for privacy reasons. Anna has been starting drama for the last 6 weeks. We've been having arguments back to back and they all start with Anna. But for some reason Anna always targets my best friend who I'll be calling Lila, also for privacy reasons. Anna always says that Lila is being mean to her and targeting her. I have to admit sometimes Lila does get mad, and starts saying some rude things but it's not as bad as Anna says it is. For the targeting, Lila has grown to hate Anna. But Lila has really been trying to be Anna's friend. I personally don't like Anna either, because I hate drama and that's all she's been causing. Anyways, Lila, me and one other girl in the group have been planning to drop her or kick her out of the group. We haven't done anything about that yet, but Lila decided it was time. So, Lila texted me today after school telling me that she dropped Anna and sent me screenshots of her saying that she doesn't want to be her friend anymore because she's been targeting her. I haven't figured out how to show a picture here yet so I'll just copy and paste what she said and replace her name with Anna.
""hey anna ur still in our friend group but personally i dont want to be friends with you, i know u prolly dont care but i feel like every time we fight u always turn it on someone eles or say that were targerting you. so bye! (i hope maybe you dont take this the wrong way)""
As soon as she sent me this I said ""Why would you do that?"" Because I just knew it was going to cause more drama and Anna was going to turn this all on Lila. I could tell just by reading it that Lila just dug her own hole. I kind of flipped out on her and said things like, ""Your just starting more drama by saying that"" and ""There's going to be so much drama now"". I honestly regret saying things like that because it was kind of rude, but I stand by it. Then Lila got upset and starting typing in our group chat that maybe she's the one starting the drama and maybe she should leave. Something in me just snapped and I gave her a very harsh reality check. I said ""Lila can u please just stop? As of right now, you are causing drama. Not even by whatever you think you did wrong but because your saying this. Nobody wants you out of the group so just stop. All this is doing is making more drama and it's not something I want to deal with right now. I'm tired and I don't want to hear you say ""I should leave"" when you know dang well that nobody wants you gone so just stop"" And now she's saying that she's not trying to be an attention seeker and she knows we hate her. I can't help but agree with her, but feel horrible. Lila is naturally a kind and amazing person and I feel like I just broke her. I feel so bad, but I don't regret saying it.

We have been friends for many years and we wanted to help get him out of a bad spot. My partner suggested giving him our extra room & adding him to the lease for our apartment. I thought it was a fine idea, and he happily accepted the offer. Before we started the process, we brought him to the apartment, showed him around, and showed him the room that would be his. Everything went smoothly and we added him to our lease. Here’s where everything starts to go down hill.
The first month, he purchased an ESA kitten, Pea. Not a big deal, my partner and I also have one. But he doesn’t take care of him. He locks him out of his room, doesn’t clean his litter box, and doesn’t feed him. At first I just thought maybe it was just adjusting to having a new pet, and new responsibilities. It wasn’t. After many conversations about taking care of Pea, he only responded with ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry’ or nothing, and would just ignore the situation.
He hasn’t done any sort of cleaning since he moved in. Its a struggle to get him to do chores. He won’t load because he doesn’t like touching the dirty dishes. I understand that, I’m autistic, and I have to be wearing my dish gloves when I’m loading the dishwasher, because gross. When I suggested what worked for him, he got really upset and refused to talk to me for days. He still won’t come to me about things, and instead goes to my partner. This month however, things took a major dip. I went to the ER late one night and had a emergency surgery. I was on heavy painkillers, and slept for almost a week and a half. I got a call from the office asking about a 700$ charge that hadn’t been paid in my account. I was confused, I had mostly assumed that he would paid the rent, considering he had for the two months prior. When I brought it up to him, he insisted he sent the money, when I looked, it was for last month’s rent. I brought it up again, trying to make it less awkward by joking around and just telling him mistakes happen. He responds by complaining to me that its going to take up all his paycheck. I told him that I could pay 100$ of it but thats genuinely all I could do, because I had been in the ER, and have missed a week and a half of work without pay. He stormed off, saying I was a bad friend. Now he’s not talking to me, and he still hasn’t paid his rent.
I talked to my mom about it, and she said I was being too rough on him, and to offer to pay half. I told her absolutely not, and she told me I was being stuck up. So I just want to know if I’m the asshole?
EDIT : Thank you all for your advice, and reassurance. My partner and I have talked, and come to a decision based on the seriousness of this whole thing. He has until tomorrow at 1pm to pay or me and my partner are leaving. I’ve talked to my mother and told her that if she thinks I’m being too harsh then she can pay his bills. She wasn’t happy. :3 I will be taking Pea with me, he’s too precious to leave behind.",,t3_1gri6d1,AITA

We all are very close and spend almost every lunch break together. Recently there was an argument between me and the younger friend, lets call her Mia. So Mia wanted to hang out today, so yesterday she sent us a text in our gc, saying if we wanted to go to a bar. I told her that i wouldn't be able to go because I wanted to save up for the summer trip we are all planning to go. Mind you it was her that brought up the idea of the trip.
After me saying that her answer was that we dont hang out that much and that it was I that didn't wanna hang out with her. I told her that was in fact not true, and eventually cave in and said that i will come. After like 5 minutes she randomly said. ""Okay, u clearly dont wanna go so lets not"". Me and my other friend where really taken aback and asked her if she was ok. She told us that she isn't feeling well and doesn't wanna hang out today after school anymore.
I should also note that almost every time we go out, it's because she wants to drink. Even when we went to the cinema she got something to drink, even though both me and my other friend didn't buy anything to drink. We thought we would all be sober and just talk. So what do you think?

The last several months, his car has very frequently failed to start. We're often on the phone when it happens, and it seems to really stress him out and takes several minutes for him to fix. Despite this, he doesn't seem to take repairing it as a priority. He brushes it off after the fact because ""it starts running eventually"" and doesn't have a plan to fix it.
I worry a lot about it, because of the stress it causes him and also out of fear it'll eventually fail entirely and land him in bigger trouble. For those reasons, I, as his best friend, have strongly suggested a couple times that he have it looked at when he gets the chance.
He never ever raises his voice at me — but did so the last time I brought it up. His argument is that that he has no time to go to a mechanic and can't go without his car for the time that it'll take to get fixed. His parents work during the day, and his grandparents stay at home but don't like it when he drives their car.
These are valid reasons, but I also consider the fact he's young, lives at home with his well-off family, and has classes only a couple hours a day. The main obstacle is his job at a local family-run store that he (admirably) takes very seriously. I've reminded him his employers are very nice people and would almost certainly grant him a day off for something so important, and that I do believe his family would be able to support him if he asked. He just does not like to ask for help and I'm trying to reassure him that it's okay to.
It really, really rattled me when he rose his voice at me and I'm trying to figure out if I'm a total butthole for insisting he fix his car. I will stop bringing it up, I just love him so much and worry about him.",,t3_1gs1d31,AITA

From the first night, he wanted to stay out drinking until early morning. I was up for it the first night but wanted to mix it up with some sightseeing during the day. Every night, he kept pushing to stay out later than I was comfortable with (we’re talking 2 a.m. or later). When I’d call it a night, he’d complain and guilt-trip me, saying holidays are for staying out late.
Things escalated when he got wasted, threw up in Ubers, lost his phone, and I spent the next day helping him track it down and paying the driver £30 to get it back. Despite all this, he still wanted to keep going out and even started calling me “Sleepy Joe” because I didn’t want to be out until dawn every night.
On our last night, I told him he was acting like a teenager and that I didn’t sign up for a week of non-stop partying.

Rachelle-_-17,WIBTA if I got married without my family knowing?,2024-11-15T01:52:49.064000+0000,34,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grlehz/wibta_if_i_got_married_without_my_family_knowing/,"For context, I am not very close with my family. I rarely talk to or visit my sister, and our mother we both don't speak to anymore.. sort of. My sister cares about me deeply, but because of our age gap (12 years) and her living out of state, I don't update her often on what all is going on with my life. According to what she knows, I have poor taste in men. I'd rather skip the questions of what kind of person he is and how long have we been together, etc.. I want her to know, but I don't want to deal with the relationship interrogation.
Our mother, however, is a different story. She's a very self-centered ""better than thou"" type of woman. She's the type of person to ask ""Whats in it for me?"" before you even think of asking her for any help. She has a track record of being neglectful and rude to her children, husband, and friends if it benefited her more to do so. Hence, she has no husband, children, or friends anymore. She would be devastated if I didn't involve her in any of it, but she would make the whole situation (engagement, wedding, honeymoon, etc.) all about her if she knew. I don't want that for my fiancé, especially because she would be the typical MIL.
Side note: there is no money or family money to pay for the wedding. I come from a very low-class household, as does he, and all his family has passed.. whereas mine might chip in if I got closer with them.. but I wouldn't want to do that just to have our wedding paid for.
Would I be the asshole if I just enjoyed our wedding.. or rather more likely an elopement.. instead of cluing them in and letting them be a part of it?
Edit: Someone asked me if my sister would have cause of concern in order to ask those questions, and if I, in turn, was avoiding her in order to go through with it anyway. As far as he goes, no, she wouldn't have cause for concern with this one. A lot of judgment from friends and family both when I informed them he's 5 yrs older and had been previously married with 2 kiddos. I've known him for 3 years, but we started dating early this year.
My sister does know these answers, but she likes to keep asking questions because she was very reckless when it came to men at my age. She raised me when I was a baby/toddler because our mom would just forget I existed at times. Then she had moved out to get away from our mother when I was old enough to feed/cook for myself at the age of 5. I was left behind, and she started adult life earlier. Now that I'm in the adult world, we talk again. She knows her moving out made us distant, but I also know our mother had a play in it, too. She would speak badly about my sister all the time to me, and as a 6-year-old kid, she would tell me that she was going to ""hell"" because of her actions, and then, in detail, she would describe what she thought hell was like with a lot of gore and pain, and what my sister would do there.. I was SIX. I would call my sister bawling my eyes out begging her to not go to hell.
We aren't as close as I'd like to be, but with limited finances on both ends, we can't visit each other more than once a year, and our busy schedules have us calling MAYBE once a month. I'm always worried I'll disappoint her, but I know I'm not embarrassed of my boyfriend. She's just never met any of my ""partners"" and I'm worried how it would go if she knew... before or after. Her opinion means a lot to me, even though our history isn't all that great.",,t3_1grlehz,AITA

I stood up and asked them why they were being so mean, “it’s his hair and he can do with it as he pleases. If he likes it, then it's none of your business”.
I was rude and, as such, got told to fuck off, got told that it's none of my business how they address him, etcetera.

The last time I spoke to them was when I was 16. Through my young adult years they did nothing significant to spend anytime with me. When I was 9 years old my grandfather told me “my golf trip was more important than attending your communion”. He had already postponed it twice and didn’t want to disappoint his friends again. Since he was not going to be there, my grandmother predicted that something would go wrong. My grandmother asked my 10 year old brother to save a pew for my aunt and uncle who were running late. He was uncomfortable to do so and it was near impossible because of the church being packed. Although, my father had taken care of this by asking my brother to sit in a pew and save the seats for our Aunt’s family. A year later they cut my family and I off because of whole communion ordeal.
Since they never really respected me, why should I pay respects to them at their funeral? My father thinks I should be the better person and go. I shouldn’t let other peoples inappropriate actions influence the type of person I am. However, I feel they wouldn’t come to my funeral if I passed before them. In example, I had complicated surgery earlier this year and when my father told my grandfather about it. He said and did nothing. With all of this I don’t want to attend their funerals when they do pass. Am I the asshole here?",,t3_1grjwvt,AITA

My guardians were my cousin (hereafter referred to as ""Mom"") and her partner (hereafter referred to as ""Dad""). They are not married despite being together for over 20 years. I should note that my relationship with Mom is strained due to years of her emotional and verbal abuse. I keep my distance to protect my sanity and to maintain some semblance of ""peace.""
Dad's mom (my ""grandma"") passed away recently and the funeral home put up an obituary page for family and friends to post pictures, memories, etc. I have a particularly fond memory in which I asked Dad's mom if she'd be my grandma. I was 11 years old and just lost my mother and thrust into this whole new environment, my actual grandparents were dead, and I was an understandably lonely kid looking for an actual familial connection.
Anyway, I wrote about this memory, and in the most neutral way possible, I wrote at the end, ""I was just a kid with no living parents or grandparents being raised by her son and his partner, and [Grandma] claimed me as part of her family, loving me all the same."" Then signed off by saying I loved her.
At the wake and the funeral Mass, Mom refused to hug me but wouldn't tell me why, just that she ""didn't feel like it."" Then after the funeral, Dad called me and SCREAMED at me about how I disrespected him, that people are asking who his partner is as if he had a gay partner on the side, how could I be so malicious, if I had a problem with my mom that I should bring it to her and not broadcast it for all to see on his mother's funeral page, that I was a selfish little bitch and made it about me, etc. We argued, he screamed at me some more and hung up.
We went a week without talking until he finally called me to apologize and explained his side, saying that I should've asked for his approval first before posting and that I shouldn't have included them at all if it wasn't meant to be malicious. I maintained that I didn't write what I wrote to be malicious - I was telling a story that wasn't about him or Mom, that it wasn't my fault that people were misinterpreting what I said, and that he should've clarified with me before asking anyone else's opinion and getting crazy with me. I also expressed that I was angry with him for not giving me the benefit of the doubt and for speaking to me the way he did.

I (F20) have been together with my boyfriend (M22) for almost 3 years. I have known his family for about the same amount of time. I spend every 2 weekends at his place and have gone on hangouts and small trips with them. I was thinking of getting them a family holiday gift. They really love self-care things like lavender soaps, creams, etc. I work at a shop that happens to cater to their taste. I was wondering if it would be okay to buy them a gift from there. Since I work there, I get a 40% discount. I work minimum wage and part-time with about maybe 10 hours a week if I am lucky.
I do not want to make them think I am insulting them by buying something from my work that gives me a discount. Obviously, I would not just buy one things but a couple to make a bundle that they can enjoy as a family putting them around the house. I thought it would be an easy gift as it is less likely to miss the mark as with clothes or others; it is also an easy way to make the gift for the family as a whole rather than buying them one by one (I do not have the money for so much).

NightOwlIvy_93,WIBTA if I don't let FIL see his only grandchild until he apologized to his son (my husband),2024-11-14T12:02:06.073000+0000,331,146,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gr388x/wibta_if_i_dont_let_fil_see_his_only_grandchild/,"My (30f) husband (30m) is the only child of his father (82m). His parents have been divorced since he was 4 years old but still have a friendship relationship. My FIL is old as I already mentioned and has the mindset of a typical retired man. Over the last couple of years his health has started to slowly decline. He has prostate cancer which is luckily an easy battle, he's getting more forgetful as you do with age and obviously can't do the things a young person can. He's gotten slow and all that. He is still able to live alone and my husband regularly does the shopping for him and helps him out with odd jobs he can't do on his own or are too dangerous for him. As of now he always comes by every week to hang out with us and our toddler who he loves very much obviously.
The thing is, my FIL can be very petty. He has lost many friends and his wife over the years because of his behaviour. He has such strange expectations of people and if they don't meet his expectations he doesn't talk to them. My father has known him for over 30 years and apparently he's always been like that. So he the only thing he does all day is visit the doctor and stay at home all day since he has nobody to talk to. It's a different generation, I get it but still, it is mainly his own fault for being alone.
Yesterday my husband had gone to his dads home to bring his shopping and he was immediately berated for not taking him to one of his gardens. Basically last Saturday my MIL came to babysit and we took our big lawnmower and other tools to a garden in another village that belongs to my FIL and we cut the grass, bushes and trees. That garden was my FIL passion over most of his adult life but can't take care of it anymore for obvious reasons. My husband and I did all the work and sadly didn't get everything done cause it was getting late.
When my husband told him about that yesterday he exploded, saying we should have taken him along with us. Mind you, it was a very spontaneous decision cause the weather was good for that sort of work on Saturday and we had taken him along before but he had always been in the way. And we would have to drive him home and such since he doesn't have a car.
My husband was obviously very upset about that argument. He works full time and taking care of that garden is an extra thing that he doesn't really like to do since it's extra work. We already have our own house and garden AND the one where his dad lives so that's three gardens in total. Also, we don't pick any of the fruit from that garden or use it in general since we have our own. We literally only go to that garden to keep everything trimmed and healthy.
FIL hasn't apologized after that argument and he's supposed to come to visit today. I'm really thinking about only letting him inside the house and letting him see his only grandchild if he apologizes to my husband.
WIBTA if I don't let FIL see his granddaughter until he apologizes?
Edit: my husband told me he doesn't want his father in the house unless his dad is ready to apologise.
Edit2: my daughter has already seen one of their hefty arguments and was very frightened. I want to protect her from that
Edit3: thank you for all the feedback. It's a difficult situation although he didn't come to our house that day. I might post an update here since he will likely come next week. We shall see.",,t3_1gr388x,AITA
Throwaway395589302,AITA for not explaining to my partner why I'm not in a good mood? ,2024-11-15T07:05:16.674000+0000,10,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grqqu5/aita_for_not_explaining_to_my_partner_why_im_not/,"I've been having a fairly downer past month. Not insanely bad, but just a lot of small things building up and just draining all my energy.
Now, here's the thing. I've generally managed to keep a strong face through all of it and been able to stay optimistic about things and generally was able to, if nothing else, come off as fairly upbeat.
Now, the past few weeks, not often, but there are times where the day just felt especially shitty that I'd rant about something to my GF and she'd just kinda blow me off. First time, I did it in-person, but she got upset with me for it, saying 'I was complaining about a non issue' and, what irked me the most was she said 'boo fucking hoo poor you'. I'm fine with being criticized. Hell, I'm even fine with being criticized about things I'm complaining about. I always felt it was healthy to be able take that criticism to look deeper on how I feel about something. But, the one thing I have said time and time and time again, both to her, in the presence of her, and explained to her, is I absolutely hate being blown off— I hate being told my opinion or feeling are invalid.
The same shit happened a lot from my uncle whenever he'd get into religious tirades and tried to claim he knew better and my perspective mattered not since he had more world experience, friends blew off anything I'd say about events, media, etc. if I wasn't as experienced in it than they are, but to have that come from my partner who I've probably explained this to a dozen times at this point— felt genuinely painful.
And that was kinda a turning point. It wasn't a completely downhill drop, but my mood just kept diminishing day by day. I ended up venting another two times over messages while I was out and... just nothing. Not a reply. I know she sees it. Just doesn't respond. Then, the next time we meet up, she talks like it never happened.
Again, I wanna be clear— I don't have some kind of terrible life. Just a pretty average life. But just a lot of small things have been building up constantly and, mix that with a diagnosed depressive order, as well as not being able to afford anti-depressants anymore, I'm completely at the end of my line and just in a state of existing.
The thing is, my girlfriend noticed this— and, when she asked why I was feeling and talking the way I did, I just said 'just kinda happened. No reason'.
That being said, I don't really wanna tell her about those things for two primary reasons:
I don't want her blaming herself for my mood being crap. Yeah, it was admittedly part of it, but it's also a lot of other things that don't have her to do with it.
Maybe, worse for how I look, I just feel like it's a lost cause. I've almost given up on trying to explain that the way she ignores my venting hurts me a lot. I only say almost because I'm still thinking about it— why I'm making a post here.",,t3_1grqqu5,AITA

The problem is a resident cornered me a few months ago and asked for my phone number. I didn't feel comfortable saying no. Today they texted me with a basic question about an upcoming project that they should already know the answer to if they read any of the dozens of emails or town halls management sends out.
I blocked them without saying anything because I don't want to interact with them.
I was considering informing them that they should direct basic questions to management but honestly I don't want to deal with them at all and have no personal relationship with them or interest in having one. This is such a basic question that I am honestly shocked that they asked.

We kept our relationship to ourselves because Ella wasn't out to her family. (This is important later). A month ago Ella got a text from her mom (41F) inviting us to a 'cookout' at her new boyfriend's house which is about a 1 1/2 hr drive from us. In the past, we have met her boyfriend a few times, but we were a little hesitant. This is also not a long-term relationship (probably around 3-4 months) and quoting Ella: ""It will not be her last due to her history"". We ended up going and when we got there we got this laundry list of things we needed to do from her mom, let's call her Martha (because we will be talking about her a lot). This was not so we could help move furniture and decorate someone else's house for Halloween that we barely knew. I could tell that Ella was getting annoyed throughout the day but everything started when Martha, Ella, and I were all putting together some furniture.
As we were putting the furniture together, I felt like it was a little too quiet throughout the house so I went to go check on the kids, (4, 6, and 10 yo). I was gone for about 20ish minutes, but when I came back I could tell something was wrong. Ella seemed completely distraught and I knew that something had happened. The rest of the night was very awkward and Martha kept giving me weird looks and bad vibes. When we went to leave, we drove a little down the road until Ella pulled over and completely broke down. When I asked what was wrong she said her mom was completely against the idea of us being together. Ella said the conversation started because Martha had asked if we were living together ""as friends, or more than friends"" Ella then responded with, ""how would you feel if it was more than friends?"" which caused Martha to blow up at her saying things such as, does she (being me) even have a plan for her life, are you just going to follow her. Blah Blah. To sum it up, Martha believes that if we were to move in together, we would invite gay men over to get pregnant. A couple of days later I told Ella that her mom is a homophobe based on the conversations I had overheard and been told about in the past and that I wanted to talk to her about this. I want to tell Martha that this is not a way to treat her daughter and that she needs to grow up and stop being jealous of Ella just because Martha ruined her 20s by getting pregnant with her at 19. (Context: For the last 4 years, all Martha has asked or pushed Ella about is getting a boyfriend, to quote: ""You need to put yourself out there, find yourself a nice boy to settle down and move in with"". Almost every single conversation until now when I just happen to be another woman) Ella wasn't entirely opposed to the idea but we've talked about the situation to some close friends and they told me that ITA if I were to go off on Martha. So, WIBTA?
EDIT: I just want to clarify because I don’t think I explained it well, but I would not just call her out the blue. This would be a situation if she were to start something towards Ella.",,t3_1grpul4,AITA

My work is hosting a turkey drive on a SUNDAY (I don’t work weekends) in time for thanksgiving and I really don’t want to go.
I was originally planning on going because I understood that I was getting paid for my time. Today I asked to confirm and was told I will be volunteering my time. When I asked if it was obligatory I was told “it’s expected but not mandatory” I’m on the spectrum and am having a hard time what that means. Especially because when I said “so I don’t have to come?” my boss just went mmm
I want to justify it by saying “oh at least I can hang out with my coworkers” but they’re all racist and misogynistic. I do not like them. I do not want to be around them but I need money and to keep my job.
I don’t think I should do obligated to go to a work event that’s unpaid. But I also think it might be rude to not “”give back to the community””

Chance-Oven856,AITA for not going to estranged parents 70th bday party?,2024-11-14T18:03:32.233000+0000,92,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grazca/aita_for_not_going_to_estranged_parents_70th_bday/,"My family wants me to fly out of state to attend my mother's 70th birthday. We have been estranged since 2022 when she called me a ""piece of shit"" for having lunch with my sisters when we were in NY celebrating my son's high school graduation with our family.
Since we live 2000 miles away we rarely get home. My mother was angry that she had to babysit my sisters kids (although she volunteered) instead of having lunch with us. We have only spoken briefly and infrequently since then.
Last year my Dad turned 70. I was in Canada and near home so I drove to his birthday party. My Dad and I have had a tenuous relationship (he married my mom when I was 6 - my bio dad died when I was 2) but he has made a lot of effort to fix our relationship. I was happy to celebrate him.
While I was there I did speak to my Mom who agreed to some of the requests I made (better communication, effort on her behalf to show interest in me and my family, etc) - this was Nov 2023 and she did not contact me again until March 2024 - she said ""it was a good day to move forward"" I agreed - said I was happy to hear it - and then she never contacted me again.
I turned 50 this summer and my sisters flew out to surprise me. My mother did not come as we were not on speaking terms AND it was at a bar with drinks, drugs and generally wild behavior. I was not upset AT ALL that she didn't come - I didn't want her there - but she then proceeded to completely ignore my birthday. Didn't send a card, a text, make a call or a gift - just no acknowledgment whatsoever that I even turned 50.
Now, she is turning 70 in a few weeks. I told my sisters early on while they were planning that I would not attend unless our Mom invited me directly and apologized for her behavior. I never heard anything from my Mom. Now my Dad is sending me texts offering to pay for me to fly home to celebrate her birthday. My sisters are heavily pressuring me to ""be the bigger person"" and come or ""Mom may never forgive you""
This has been a life long pattern for us. I am the perpetual scapegoat and black sheep of our family. I quite honestly don't think I should have to go so she can ""save face"" because she's embarassed people will know i came for my Dad but not for her. I told my family as much and offered to send my kids (15 and 20) in my place. I am also already very busy the weekend they planned this - I have 3 parties of my own where I live with my friends - and I""m hosting one of them. I honestly feel like they are asking me to once again ""forgive"" her for terrible behavior and i feel like if I do show I'm destroying hte boundaries I've set and opening myself up again for her to treat me terribly. I've done so much therapy to move past this and don't want to set myself back. Plus - I am ALWAYS the bigger person - time and time again - and her behavior never changes.

I expressed my thought clearly that i did not understand her logic on how she went about the whole thing. i told her i’d rather a text than an ‘isolated’ gift from her the following day. in the end i didn’t collect the gift because the whole thing was just jarring. she felt bad i guess and we went our separate ways.

I spend a lot of time with her, she goes camping and hiking with me, and I used to take her work when I worked in the office but now I work from home so she’s with me 90% of the day. I leave her at home when I go to the gym everyday and when I go out with friends, but I am home during the days and my roommate is usually home in the evenings so she’s around people most of the time. Admittedly, she is needy and has separation anxiety and follows me around everywhere I go. But I still try to treat her like a dog. Despite her being needy, it hasn’t really affected any of my relationships. My boyfriend is truly one of the best humans I know. He is sweet and kind and loyal and I am so thankful for him everyday. He’s an amazing person, but the only issue I have is that he treats my dog like a baby to the extent of ignoring me. I love that he loves her. But he literally carries her around like a baby, even though I’ve asked him not to and told him that it’s not good for her to give her constant attention because it makes her separation anxiety worse. It’s come to the point where he can’t even hold a conversation with me when she’s around. If his back is turned to her, he will constantly interrupt our conversation to turn and look at her and ask “what is the baby doing?” I will come into a room and he will be petting her instead of doing work. It’s like he can’t be in the same room as her without giving her attention. I never said anything to him or anyone else, because I felt like it was ridiculous to complain that he was paying too much attention to my dog. Again, he’s an incredible boyfriend and I do love that he loves her. But last night it all came out. We were sitting and cuddling and I was telling him how much I loved him, but he couldn’t even focus on me while I told him how much I love him. He kept turning to the dog to pet her. I got upset and told him that it hurt my feelings when he can’t even pay attention for me for a couple of minutes while I told him that I loved him and that it made me feel like I love him a lot more than he loves me. I’m not a super needy person and I don’t need constant assurance from my partner that they love me or constant attention, but it upset me that he can’t even take his eyes off of her for one minute. We talked about it, and he basically said that she is too distracting and we should spend less time with her until we build a stronger foundation because it gets in the middle of our relationship. But I don’t think the issue is spending time with her. I’ve had my dog for 6 years while with two other men (my boyfriend and I started dating this year) and it was never a problem. My dog was almost always around, but she didn’t get in between my exes and I spending quality time together. I know it’s not fair to compare exes, but she also hasn’t come in between my friendships. My roommate is close to my dog, but I never feel like he’s not paying attention to me while my dog is around. My boyfriend is the only person who seems to be so distracted by her to where he can’t focus on other things. I don’t think spending less time with her is the right option and I don’t think it has to do with where we are in our relationship. This week we spent two days without her, but again when she was around he couldn’t pay attention to anyone else. I had to take her out of the room and shut the door so he could do work. This type of behavior would bother me at any stage of our relationship, because I don’t think it’s healthy. And her not being around won’t stop the problem. We’ve talked about having children and my only doubt is that he won’t be able to discipline them. The fact that he carries my dog around like a baby, despite me saying giving her constant attention is not good for her, and him responding “but she’s so cute” does worry me. I have been around children all my life and know they require a lot of attention, but also know that you cannot give them all of the attention they demand because it’s not good for them if you cave every time they want attention. You have to tell them, “Mommy is talking right now, you will have to wait”. Maybe I shouldn’t completely equate the way he treats my dog to the way he would treat or children, but it does worry me that he can’t tell her no because “she’s so cute” and pays CONSTANT attention to her even when I have told him not to because it coddles her too much and told him that he's teaching her bad habits when he stops what he's doing to give her pets every time she asks. I feel terrible for complaining that he is too loving to my dog… We are both 33 years old and this is a very serious relationship. I love him so much, he’s such a good man. Again, I love that he loves her. And I feel ridiculous to be jealous that he pays more attention to her than me. I am not a jealous, needy person and I hate complaining. But I feel like it represents more than just paying attention to the dog over me and other things.

A few years ago, something happened between myself and two people I went to high school with (now 22M, who I'll call Owen, and 22F, who I'll call Sophie - for the sake of anonymity).
A year or two after we all finished high school, Owen, who I was good friends with, started dating Sophie. I did not know at the time, and later found out that he purposefully did not tell me. From what I've gathered from mutual friends, he told them not to tell me either. This is important.
I had feelings for Owen (awful teenage drama, I know. honestly, it was more proximity attraction than anything else), and I confessed, which was when I was eventually told that the two were together (around four or five months after they'd made it official)
The two had issues in their relationship, and I was told things (later, I found out these were all lies, and ironically enough, he was lying to her as well - about me and other things)
We grew to dislike one another, and I cut my losses and blocked both of them. The two broke up after about a year, and six months after they broke up, Owen and I reconnected. Once again, things ended badly, and I cut off several people in the aftermath. We haven't spoken since, and I do not plan to either.
The issue now comes with regards to Sophie. We have mutual friends, and while I don't particularly care, I know she does not like me. At the end of the month, there will be an event one of my friends is hosting, and I recently found out Sophie would be there. While I am able to ignore and/or play nice, I'm concerned about souring the mood or ruining the event for others.
Would I be wrong not to go? For the sake of keeping peace, I am considering it, but I do not want to have to cancel every time an event is held just to keep the peace amongst our mutual friends.
Edit to add: I want to go. I probably will go. I just want to know if I'd be wrong in going, knowing it will most likely stir the pot, or at the very least, contribute to petty gossip.",,t3_1grsju2,AITA
Euneirophrennia,AITA for calling my (F31) mother selfish and unreasonable?,2024-11-15T17:34:40.133000+0000,1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs1tg7/aita_for_calling_my_f31_mother_selfish_and/,"disclaimer: I had no idea how to best formulate my question but prepare for a longish post.
My (F31) mother and I have always had a complex relationship. She's lived a hard life and my father went to work abroad when I was 7. From that time, my mother focused only on me and growing up, we had some spats and quarrels like all teens and mothers do.
My mother has a tendency to want to always be right. My whole teen-to-now life I've never worn anything without her wanting me to change into something she thought was better, I was required and expected to make zero decisions by myself and we used to have huge fights over what we'll into mu adulthood. A lot of trivial things like this have happened over this years and it's always bothered me about her. I think as a teen and in my early 20s, I felt smothered in a way but I never disrespected her.
3 years ago I met my current partner (M31) whom my mother hates. The reason why she hates him is this (she'd said it multiple times): since his father left and his mother was a wreck, he can't possibly be a good person and mean well.
She thinks that I will end up miserable like she is because i believe she cannot separate herself from my experiences.
My partner, however, is a great guy. We rent a flat together, both have jobs (and a cat), we had some bumps in the beginning but we've sorted them out and honestly I'm looking forward to spending my life with him
Fast forward to a month ago, my mom, who now suffers from Lyme disease and has had mental issues because of the illness, started attacking me regarding my relationship and mu life more frequently. Each fight escalated into her throwing me out and then begging me to come back and then gaslighted me into saying she never said or called me names that she indeed called me (such as being a constant liar, hating her, being manipulative, etc etc. I have spoken to my therapist about it before and she's already told me I need to set boundaries with her as this is toxic behavior).
I have no clue why she thinks these things and why it is currently escalating. At one point, a few days ago, I was so exhausted from the stress (I myself am ill and am awaiting hospital check ups) I told her she was hurting me and acting selfishly. She got super mad and started shoving me away. She has these beliefs that I have been turned against her. She's even once called me a spoiled bitch (though this incident happend when she took too many anxiety meds that she was proscribed).
My BF and best friend think she's in the wrong and that I'm risking getting sick permanently because of the stress. I, on the other hand, am lost and devastated because I'm not sure if she could possibly have narcissistic tendencies (a word I don't like using carelessly) or if I am crazy?
She is at the moment angry at me and has called me twice to tell me she's miserable because of me. But I don't think I am wrong to be hurt by her words and actions.
I hope this is enough and makes tense.",,t3_1gs1tg7,AITA

Anyways, I’m taking out the trash in my apartment building and see a red package in the front entrance for famous footwear with my address on it.
I didn’t open the package. I didn’t look for it. I didn’t open the mailbox. It’s not my fault the brand is on the box.
I send it to my wife and said “thanks for the shoes.” I didn’t think it would blow up. Maybe this is where I fucked up.

“Why do you have to put your nose in everything.”
Maybe 30-40 more texts come.
She starts calling me names and compared me to her cousins boyfriend, who apparently would never do this.
Now she’s not talking to me. I didn’t even want a gift. I told her no gifts.
Am I the asshole?
EDIT: If she really wanted to surprise me, couldn’t she just send it to her sisters or friends place? I also prefaced I don’t want presents. I did exactly as she asked, did not look intentionally for anything.",,t3_1grf6ll,AITA
QF_25-Pounder,AITA for not letting my roommate in the apartment?,2024-11-14T22:19:06.161000+0000,34,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grgxw7/aita_for_not_letting_my_roommate_in_the_apartment/,"I live in an apartment with my good friends Carly, John, and Sally (who is never around). Me, Carly, and Derek (another friend) went to get dinner. I caught the bus and had too much leeway, arriving 30 minutes early, but put our name in for the 40 minute waitlist. After putting in for our table, I see that I'd forgotten to turn my phone off silent from the previous day's shift, and I have ten calls from John. I message ""Jesus christ, what's up?"" Being worried someone is hurt. I see in the group chat that John and his partner Kate (who also has her own set of keys) are locked out of the apartment. I tell them I'm there and that I've put my name in, and Kate responds with a silly ""I'm dead,"" gif, so I figure it's not that serious. If I were to catch the bus back, it'd mean abandoning dinner at a restaurant I've wanted to eat at for months (and couldn't eat at again for three weeks because of my schedule), and I'm out of food at the apartment, I was relying on eating there, having leftovers, and shopping the next day. Derek parks and arrives just as our name is called to claim our table. With no word from Carly, I assume she has been contacted by John and is lending her keys. She arrives and tells us she didn't stop by the apartment, so since we've had no further communications from John since the initial lockout (no ""hey I'm on my way,"" or ""hey can you swing by?"") I assume that he must have it figured out.
We eat our food and head back to the apartment, only to find that John and Kate had to call the landlord to let them into the apartment, and they are extremely mad at us for not letting them back into the apartment, and John said we were all ""Crazy."" Am I the asshole? It's their responsibility to get into the apt, and them both forgetting their keys is an extraordinary circumstance which they are responsible for. If it was convenient, I'd certainly let them in. If I was locked out for 90-120 minutes I'd be annoyed, but it's my responsibility to remember my keys, it would be unreasonable to expect them to abandon their plans just so I can get in now instead of 90 minutes later. I already lose 30 minutes if they do head back for me, I'd be willing to wait an extra hour so they get to enjoy their evening. I'm not impatient, waiting is easy, even if I don't have a phone.
Edit: For clarification, I am asking AITA for not arranging a way for John to get into the Apt, whether that means myself or getting someone else to let John in.",,t3_1grgxw7,AITA

So, Sarah and I are both huge fans of this band, and when their concert tickets went on sale, I wasn’t sure if I could afford one right away. I told her I’d think about it. A few hours later, she texted me saying she’d “secured” two tickets for us and I could just pay her back when I was ready.
Here’s the thing—she never asked me before buying my ticket, and I never said I was 100% in. I told her I appreciated the gesture but couldn’t commit to buying the ticket, especially since I didn’t ask her to buy it in the first place.
Now she’s mad at me and says she went out of her way to make sure I didn’t miss out and that it’s unfair of me to leave her stuck with an extra ticket. She’s also telling our mutual friends I’m being a bad friend and ungrateful. I feel bad because I know she was trying to be nice, but I also didn’t ask her to do this.
So, AITA for refusing to pay her back for the ticket I never agreed to?",,t3_1gsb8tj,AITA

cookie_tin,WIBTA for telling my mom she needs to rewrite her will because I will not look after my step-siblings?,2024-11-16T00:59:27.308000+0000,380,99,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gsbpe8/wibta_for_telling_my_mom_she_needs_to_rewrite_her/,"My mother recently informed me she and my step-father are planning for the future and began drafting their wills. I was expecting her to talk about who gets great-grandmother’s sewing machine, but no.
My mother said she and my step-dad plan to leave the house to my two step-brothers and myself. To live in. It’s a large, beautiful home in a nice neighborhood, but I’ve never had any intentions of living there with my step-siblings (they live at home, I currently live with a roommate). She also stated they plan to make me legal guardian of one of my step-brothers. He has an intellectual disability and is mentally still a child though he’s 30 years old. He can take care of his own hygiene and make simple foods to eat. He still will require care his entire life. My other step-brother is autistic and works a factory job. He doesn’t appear to have any social life and has not shown any interest in moving out.
Their dad married my mom a few years ago and, honestly, I’ve only ever been close to my step-sister. We would shop and have girls’ night before she moved out of state. I feel like she or their mother (she is rarely in contact with her kids but still) would be a better option for legal guardian. I’m simply not capable of taking care of him and I feel like I am really being asked to take care of my younger step-brother too. He has very little social skills and has been allowed to live like a teenager most of his life (he’s nearly 30). He can’t cook or take care of a house. He’s very immature.
I hope to marry my partner one day. I think it would be very unfair to say “oh, btw, we have an extra person to take care and possibly this one too”. Also, we hope to move to her home country. Neither brother would be happy with that and we don’t have the money to bring them with us. My mom briefly said “if the boys have to live alone you and your sister will need to send them money to keep the house going”. This sounds very unfair and my mother justified it by saying “well, if they ever do move to an apartment you can sell the house and split it four ways - you’ll both get your money back”. Yeah, they are very unlikely to ever move if others are paying and that house would utterly deteriorate if it’s just the two of them.
I am starting to think I have no option but to tell her I don’t want to be involved in care of my step-siblings. I also don’t want to finance them, especially given the younger works and the older draws a check. They could probably manage just fine in an apartment together.
Would I be the asshole if I did that though? :(",,t3_1gsbpe8,AITA
Classic-Ad-90,AITA for not giving my friend a ride on her birthday?,2024-11-15T23:33:59.076000+0000,8,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gs9zhq/aita_for_not_giving_my_friend_a_ride_on_her/,"Important context here is I (F) live in one of the biggest major cities in the US. Parking is already a pain but where I live finding parking is PAINSTAKING. Essentially if you have a car here your life has to operate around the parking situation. If youre driving on the weekdays, you have to be in and out to beat the 9-5ers for parking. And forget about even using your car on the weekends or youll be circling the block for hours. Okay important context done.
My friend (B)F invited a group of us out for her birthday dinner. One person drove, a few people ubered (including her), and I just walked to the restaurant because it was close enough to where I live. It was a fun time and the person who drove had to leave early, taking one of the people who ubered since they lived close to eachother. That kinda ended the night so we were all figuring out getting home. The last three people decided to uber together with multiple stops and invited B to come with. But she didnt feel comfortable being the last person alone on the uber (since she lived the farthest) and had also spent quite a bit on birthday festivities so didnt want to spend more money that evening, even if the cost of the uber was split.
So she turned to me because she knew I lived so close and asked if I could drop her off at hers. It was already half past 10pm at that point so I knew I wouldnt find parking anywhere near me when I got back. My exact reply back was “Im sorry, if i move my car I wont have parking when I get back but Im happy to pitch in or cover a ride back completely to yours.”
B wasnt very happy and said she didnt want to be in a car alone with a random when shes been drinking, and Im not thinking about her safety and acting selfishly towards the birthday person. I think those are all valid points but I really couldnt express how dire the parking situation was around me.
She ended up feeling comfortable enough to grab an uber home as long as I tracked her ride, and I ended up covering it completely. But she hasnt responded to me since. So AITA should I have just given her a ride since it was her birthday after all??",,t3_1gs9zhq,AITA

I (25) moved across the country for school, and currently live in a college apartment with Joe (25) and Avery (27) (fake names). When we moved in together, we all agreed to split the bills equitably, but I somehow got stuck paying for WiFi alone.
Initially I didn’t mind as it wasn’t a huge cost, but Avery is jobless & plays Xbox for 20 hours a day trying to make it as a streamer (they have 12 followers 2 years in), causing the WiFi to lag so bad that it kicks the rest of us off.
I’ve tried talking to them about this, but Avery gets extremely aggressive, screaming at & towering over me while they have me backed into literal corners. It’s gotten to the point that I’m genuinely scared of them, and don’t feel I can say literally anything without risk of danger.
Because of this, if I need to work on homework, (and can’t due to Avery), I’ve started going into the modem settings and banning their devices. Usually I unban them right after I finish my assignments, but lately, (and unrelated to this), Avery has been even more abusive and toxic, so I have been petty and leave them banned for 2-3 days at a time.
I feel justified for the blocking their access while I’m doing homework, because I need to keep my grades up, and because I pay for it. But I’m worried I might be TA for being petty about how long I leave them blocked. So AITA?",,t3_1gsd3n6,AITA

Backstory my brother spent our entire child treating me like trash bullying hurting and on several occasions tried to kill me. And I whole admit to being an antagonist at some times. However it is widely accepted by everyone that he has anger issues, even a psychologist said that he was a lost cause but we never gave up on him. Fast forward years later and my brother approached and apologized for everything he had done and I reached back out trying to connect with him as an adult. This goes well for several years though my brother stops talking to my sisters for a reason I still think is stupid but I respected his decision and didn't push the matter. (He didn't like one of their friends who tried to push themselves on him and my sisters kept hanging out with her, doubt my sisters knew but than again my brother did the same thing to us and them and brought people we didnt like around us.)
Back to the story at hand i bring up to my brother that I want him to be my best man and the godfather of my future children. He says no siting that he hates everyone for their personal life choices and that he won't do it. Now this is ruing our relationship because he can't grow up and put up with people for a day on the most important day of my life, and I love him and just want him to be apart of my life.",,t3_1gsc90k,AITA

She has an attitude, she is manipulative, and she did some fucked up shit to me when we were younger. (I wont get into it here). Anywhoo, yesterday my mother and I went shopping after she picked me up from work the commute is over an hour so I don't get home until 6:00 at the earliest. That's if we don't stop somewhere. Mother dearest and I got groceries, and when we made it home my little sister in all her infinite wisdom had decided to read off a list of stuff that we needed, then got annoyed when she realized we didn't get any of It. (We didnt know). So I had asked her why she didn't text us this, and she replied that she was waiting for us. So I proceeded to say if it was really that important you would have texted us and she had no right to get annoyed. Let me clarify she has done this before many times. She will also say she likes something so we get it for her and all of a sudden she doesn't like it anymore and ""We should have know that"". She got angry and called me a Bitch. I will admit I was probably TA when I said she was pathetic, but in my defense I didn't do anything to warrant being called a bitch ( I don't think ). It's not the first time she has been verbally abusive to me and I'm over it at this point. Why should I buy her stuff if she is just going to complain and treat me like this? I bought her something for Christmas but last night I decided I'm not going to get her anything else. She has a job, she can buy food. As for Christmas I'm not buying her anything, ever again. I'm not going to use my hard earned money on her when I'm treated that way. So Reddit WIBTA If I stopped spending my money on my little sister and didn't get her Christmas?",,t3_1gr691r,AITA

Then there's the helping with homework, cooking, house chores, etc... The weekends, though less busy, are also filled with chores, driving, visiting family, and such. In sum, we have litle time for ourselves as a couple, and almost no time alone individually.
This year, my company is giving everybody the birthday off. Mine is a Monday a couple of weeks from now.
When I told my family this, they were exited: my wife said that I should swing by her workplace in order for us to have lunch together. The kids said that I should pick them up from school to have lunch.
I said, sorry, but I was planning on having the day to myself.
They were a bit desapointed, and I felt a bit guilty.
I love my family, but I was planning on going near the beach, walk a bit, and have a nice meal enjoying the ocean view, earing no other sound, but the waves and the seagulls. Besides, I'll be spending my actual birthday with them, we're going away for the weekend.

I have a minimum wage job (about $180 a month), am disabled (high functioning autism), and am currently working through college from home.
Since I've been getting a steady income for myself without any debts or any utilities to pay for, I believed that I could slperge a bit on two big things. The things I got were about $200 - $400 each, and thinking that because it's my money, I don't need to tell anyone about it.
A while after I got these things, one of my parents found out about my purchases and got incredibly angry at me. That I can't be trusted to do anything because I act like a child and not an adult. That people my age are a million times more accomplished than I am and with how I've been acting I'm going to end up homeless. They even told me that they're considering making me a ward of the state since I apparently can't take care of myself.
In the end, they set me up a budgeting plan and a rule that I'm not allowed to spend more than $50 on anything and then left me alone. I get where they were coming from. That I'm not focusing on the important things like a potential home for myself or a car. But at the same time I didn't even know that they were even things I was going to be saving for (I've pretty much gave up on trying anything). Getting told that I should've been saving for these things without ever knowing makes me feel like I've been a parasite on my family and that I'm just a horrible person.

Before going nuts let me say full story. P and I do not have a really good relationship and I do not forgive them nor will I try to fix it as I already try to in the past. Now P told me over texts and I said no and got ignored so I shrugged it off then G comes home and I talk to them cause I want to be respectful then I get cut off telling me I’m being selfish and an asshole. G knows my relationship and how I hate that sports game especially being in hot weather and crowed places with drunk or people being too close to you who are sweaty and crap. G says I’m being selfish and it’s just 1 day and I need to get over then I told them what if they were in my shoes which they evaded and called me an ashsole and to leave their room. Anyways GB bought those tickets for a surprise forgot to tell you and talked about with G. From my POV. I understand GB wanted to do nice things and get closer but I shouldn’t be forced or obliged to go cause tickets were expensive, surprise, and to get closer. They could have just done a dinner, hike, or theme park idk but I feel like sports game is too much. Even going to a park that’s better and free especially. In my opinion I understand but sorry not sorry I’m not going cause my reasons especially with P. And the way I got treated too I straight up got attacked it’s like I told them their past tramua but I’m a human with feelings too and I’m not gonna let people strip it down cause oh the tickets were expensive or it’s a surprise. Sorry not sorry but if it’s gonna be a sport or travel or anything expensive make sure you know they like the sport or know they have good terms with other people. Also game is in a few or couple months and the tickets were like 80 to 300 each idk each website had different websites with same seatings or similar. I even offered to pay back or help them sell the ticket but it will make them “uncomfortable” AITA?

She said it would take her some time to heal and forgive but she accepted the apology. But while we were calming down she talked to her mom.

My girlfriend told me that she (her mother) wants me to call and “explain” myself to her and than maybe ill be allowed back at thanksgiving. I told my girlfriend I do not want to call her because 1- We figured it out and we are all good now. 2- I am not dating her mother so I don’t owe her an “apology” or “explanation”.

Worried_Radish7316,WIBTA to ask my (separated) husband for the key back to my house?,2024-11-14T02:23:42.176000+0000,973,401,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqugix/wibta_to_ask_my_separated_husband_for_the_key/,"I (45F) am separated from my husband (41M). We have two kids in primary school.
The kids and I moved into a house in March while my husband stayed in our old apartment. We made a commitment to co-parent as collaboratively as possible. I gave him a key to my new home to make co-parenting more comfortable for him when I am out of town for work.
Since I moved out, I have been covering all expenses for the kids (clothes, food, school costs, etc.). I asked if he could start contributing financially because it was getting tough to do it all on my own. In August, he started giving me $200 every two weeks for the kids.
A few months ago, the shower caddy in my bathroom fell and it broke the drain stopper in the tub. I bought a new one, but had trouble with it. My husband came over to look at it and said I bought the wrong one. He said, ""Don't worry - I'll take care of it for you and the kids."" He purchased a new drain stopper and came over to install it. One week later, he sent me $180 on Venmo with an emoji of two kids (suggesting that this was the money to help with the kids' expenses). He then sent me a text that said, ""I sent you $180. I deducted $20 from the $200 to cover the drain stopper I bought and installed.""
I told him this was a miserable move on his part, but he insisted that he shouldn't have to pay for the drain stopper for my house. He deducted $20 from his kids' financial support to pay for something that his kids benefit from. So, now I want to ask him to give me the key to my house back.

She really tries to make nice things for others (for example, she is organizing my baby shower at the office). She is hosting a dinner at her place next month. She invited a few people from our office along with their partners. She sent an invitation for me and my husband about a month ago (so 2 months in advance of the event) and asked us to rsvp last week.
My husband has a night shift scheduled that day, so he won’t be able to come. I would be going by myself, except that there are some important complications:
I will be 7 months pregnant at that point, and driving long distances is complicated for me because my legs get tired.
The dinner is on the outskirts of the city in one direction, and I live in the outskirts to the other direction. The drive there is at least 1.5 hours and it could be more if there is traffic.
I have a medical appointment scheduled for earlier that day for an immunoglobuline vaccine (I didn’t pick the date for the appointment) and I’m not sure what side effects I’ll have right after the vaccine.
I told my friend that we won’t be able to make it to her dinner, thank her very much for the invitation, and told her that I wanted to take her out for lunch one day when we are both working in person to catch up.
She said she would love it if I could come and asked if there was any way I could make it. She even offered to have her sibling pick me up and take me to the dinner and back. And this is why I think I might be the AH
There are technically many ways that I could accommodate this dinner and actually attend, but I honestly don’t want to make an effort. My husband already has to ask for a lot of changes in his shifts to come with me to medical appointments so he doesn’t want to ask for more changes for a non-medical event, taking extra time to make a stop on my way back is not that appealing since it would be dark already, and to be honest, making small talk with her sibling on my way to dinner and back in addition to having to socialize during dinner is just not something that I want to do at this point.
I’ve had a healthy pregnancy so far, but in terms of symptoms and emotionally, I’m a mess. I get tired very easily, I cry all day, and I am uncomfortable 24/7. I’m just not in a good place to make a big effort to go to a social event, but I feel bad because she has been planning this dinner for a long time and the fact that her sibling is willing to drive 4+ hours to take me to dinner makes me feel like I should put more of an effort to be there.
WIBTA if I reject her offer and don’t make any effort to attend this dinner even when I technically could do it?",,t3_1gr9vi8,AITA
iamodysseus2001,AITA For Scolding My Sister For Not Doing Things Herself?,2024-11-14T17:30:20.704000+0000,62,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gra64h/aita_for_scolding_my_sister_for_not_doing_things/,"My little sister (17F) has been living like a 'princess' in the house since she was born. She never helped doing any house chores such as sweeping, mopping, dusting, etc. She doesn't even clean up her own room. All my life, my elder sister and I have been doing all of these, including cleaning up her room. Yes, we could've asked her to help with the chores, sure. Here's the thing, she would get mad and start arguing just because we ask her to help out or be responsible since she's also living under the same roof as us. That's why we just kept quiet, did the chores ourselves, and never asked her for help because we're just too exhausted of these constant unnecessary arguments, and we also don't want to stress out our parents who are already in their 50s. Besides doing chores, she would always come to me to help her with the most basic things that even a 10 year old could do, such as fixing her chair, opening a jar or a bottle with a tight lid, fixing her loose water bottle, and other things that anyone can do themselves.
So here's why I'm writing this. Yesterday, she came into my room for help as usual. She wanted me to fix her correction tape because the tape came off. It is fixable, but I realised, the reason why she's always asking for help is because she never solved problems by herself. That's probably why she never learnt these basic life skills because she always depends on us and expects others to help her out. So, I said ""no"" and lied by saying ""it's not fixable"". But that's not it. I also said ""no"" because I was busy and not in the mood.
Last night, I was busy with my final year thesis, so I was already stressed out. And when she asks for help, she's always demanding and forceful, even after you've said 'no' for the hundredth time. Add that situation with my already bad mood, yeah that's a recipe for disaster. I got mad at her, yelled at her, and just told her the truth. I don't remember the exact words, but it's something like ""You should start doing things yourself and solving your own problems. Stop being selfish by always expecting others to help you out, and stop being narcissistic by being mad at others and blaming others when you're the one who's being selfish for not using your own brain to fix or solve something. You're 17 years old, not 7 years old. You need to grow up and be independent."" and then I also reminded her about all the things her elder sister and I had done for her since she was born to further prove my point that she is selfish and never done anything at home to help the family out. Well, she got mad and we argued for like a good 30 minutes. Thank god, my parents weren't home, otherwise they would get stressed out, which is the last thing I want.
I've kept it in my chest for so long, and I'm tired of playing this 'good' brother who's actually being taken advantage of by his little sister. I don't believe that I am the asshole because it's true that she has never done anything at home. What do you think?",,t3_1gra64h,AITA
Throwawaygirl371947,WIBTA if I do not give my partner equity in the house in exchange for housework? ,2024-11-13T19:37:22.022000+0000,3385,1257,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqlgc3/wibta_if_i_do_not_give_my_partner_equity_in_the/,"This dispute involves the following parties: Me (33F) and my partner (36M). Throwaway!
I have a good corporate job; I bought a townhouse 7 years ago when I was single. Met my partner 3 years ago. He moved into my townhouse. Pays occasional (well below market value) rent, buys occasional groceries. I cover well over 80+% of the expenses. My partner is a PhD student. When he moved in with me he cut a LOT of expenses. He no longer had to work his shitty part time job to pay his rent in a shared apartment with 4 other guys. My partner does do more housework than I (60/40 split), and he cooks more often (65/35). I do not mind this arrangement; I care about him deeply and we generally get along well and have a caring relationship.
The issue is this: I am selling my townhouse and buying a house. I am fronting the entire cost, and am the only one on the mortgage. Before we move in, I asked my partner to sign a cohabitation agreement (basically a prenup for non married people). I gave him the agreement, which basically said I keep the house and doesn’t owe spousal support in the event of a breakup. We got in a big fight because my partner wants to have equity in the house because of the housework he does. I think this is unfair. I know enough divorced couples to know you should always plan for the future. I’m worried about having to sell the house if we break up in order to pay him out.
Am I crazy? AITA if I stick to my guns?
EDIT: a few people are asking why this is even an issue if we aren’t married. In my jurisdiction, if you cohabitate long enough you are considered common law spouses. We are getting to the point where if we break up, he would have a lot of the same rights as he would if we were married.",,t3_1gqlgc3,AITA
ProbablyAH,WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that the chocolate contains sugar?,2024-11-13T20:42:33.255000+0000,2602,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqn0b1/wibta_if_i_dont_tell_her_that_the_chocolate/,"Update: We talked yesterday and I told her that the chocolate contains sugar. She looked at me a little confused and said:“ Yes, I know? But I like it.“
So the misunderstanding came about like this: She bought herself chocolate shavings without added white sugar and told me about it. When she went shopping some weeks later she saw her favorite ones (dark chocolate) and decided that it was not worth the extra effort for her to get the other ones. She also told me, they don’t have the same crunch, so she decided to go with the „regular“ ones.
So thanks to those, that gave me the „extra nudge“. She smiled and told me I should‘ve told her directly. Have a great rest of the week.
—————————————————————
Hello, my partner (f in her 30s) is quite into sport and not much into sweets.
She stopped eating ADDED sugar „completely“ about a year ago. She doesn’t have a medical constitution, but just realized, that she‘s doing way better without the sugar. She also doesn’t restrict my eating. For example, when we went to a fancy cake place I wanted to go to, she also ate cake, but was feeling a little nauseous afterwards. So she‘s not completely strict-strict, as sometimes she enjoys honey or if I bake something, e.g..
Now to my dilemma: every weekend she makes coffee for us and does a „special blend“. When she made it before she used cocoa powder, but changed to dark chocolate shavings. It‘s really really nice, but I realized some days ago that she doesn’t know that there is sugar in them.
She eats her yogurt topped with them and is beaming with joy, when telling me „they don’t contain sugar“. They do, she just had the wrong column when checking them.
I really love seeing her happy and I researched before and the chocolate shavings without sugar are 1. expensive and 2. I‘m actually not able to eat them (due to intolerance). I also really support her otherwise, when cooking, baking, etc. I check twice as not to include any sugar. (I also realize on the other hand that she‘s mostly checking for Glucose and doesn’t care about fructose.)
So WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that there‘s sugar in her new found joy?
EDIT: to fix typos
2. EDIT: Thanks guys. I think I just needed a nudge to make the right decision. I‘m at her place tomorrow and will talk to her.
3. EDIT: To clarify:
I put “added” in, as people were confused. Sorry, I thought it was obvious, that one’s on my part.
The yoghurt used in the example she‘s eating has no added sugar. Yes she knows that there are different types of sugar. As I mentioned before, it‘s about added Glucose. Yes she is capable of reading. No, she‘s not stupid, as the package has two different collums as it‘s baking chocolate and one type of them has no added sugar but sweetener. Yes, I know, that there are also Health risk when consuming too much sweetener. It was a simple question guys.",,t3_1gqn0b1,AITA

I, (17 F) and S (for privacy purposes) (17 F) used to be really close best friends for multiple years.
Though for a while we have been getting distant, but we still remained cordial and at that time we decided to book essentially the same room to stay in after prom (I know this is different than actual prom, but in the area I live in, proms happen in hotels, so you have the option of booking a room to stay overnight). However, after agreeing to book the rooms together, during class w this friend she decided to tell me via a note that she didn't want to be close friends w me any more and wanted to be just friends.
This reveal of her wanting to just be friends with me was genuinely hurtful and insulting and since that day I haven't been able to look at her the same. All of the wrongs she did throughout our friendship feels amplified and I don't even want to acquaintances with her anymore. I even apologized to her for this and in turn she used her victim complex to the fullest and wrote to me about how angry she felt that I was abandoning our friendship.
Because the payments were made I thought I couldn't get out of this, but, luckily for me there were problems with the booking and everyone is getting a full refund. So I have the option to not stay with her, but instead stay with another friend.
This change will be last minute and I am not sure if my ex best friend and the other people I was going to stay with and afford booking a 3 person room.
So, would I be the asshole if I changed rooms and didn't stay with an ex friend for prom?",,t3_1grqojv,AITA

I am in a 5 year rel with my bf and we are planning to get married next year. Earlier this year, there was a girl who got so clingy with him. I told him that I am uncomfortable coz the girl keeps calling her late at night or even around 2 -4 am. Plus, the girl who lives 8 hrs away from us would asked them if he could say in bf's house whenever she'd visit the city. I talked to her nicely and told her that her actions are a bit off for me and they're making me uncomfortable. I even offered to help her find other places to stay but she'd still go there. As for my boyfriend, he said they're just friends and just wanted to be polite, but he'd limit his connections with her if that would make me feel better.
Forward to months later, the girl became close to my bf's older sister (who doesn't really like me coz I sided their cousin whom she bullied for years. She wasn't invited to their wedding.) Despite of being uncomfortable with her, I still treat the girl nicely (she knows that I do not like her), and I won't even say anything bad about her. Others notice the girl's unusual behavior and they started to wonder why she kept going to their house when she has other ""close"" friends in the city. Then, rumors started to go out that she's flirting with my bf and she's trying to ruin our relationship. She was confronted by my bf's aunt (father side), I was told. Now, my bf's sister just accuse me of being ""unreasonably jealous"" and would even send Bible-based articles about handling jealousy to their family (mother side) Group Chat, stirring the conversation. She won't even give context, she'd just say ""It will be helpful to dating couples."" His brother is the only one dating atm. She's also passive-aggressive in her approach and mostly sarcastic.
There's a family gathering around the corner and I am invited (as always), and I already feel like it will be a topic. But I don't want to tell them anything, coz whatever happens in our relationship is just supposed to be for us. My bf and I have also settled this issue between us.

I'm not perfect, there are times when I leave them for days at a time, but considering she doesn't use as many as I do, I observe that even though it's been days, the dishes that are clean are enough for her (and honestly if my habits were a problem, I'd hope she'd complain to me). There are many times that when she uses a plate, and I've seen this with my own eyes; she takes the sponge with NO soap and just gently ""scrubs"" (if you can even call it that) the plate and then puts it on the drying rack.

Constantly Bodyshames me and calls me ugly and unattractive in front of people. Provokes them to make fun of me and gets offended if someone calls me pretty.

First she helped me got into relationship with my boyfriend and now when he's serious and want to marry after I'm happily settled my mother uses slangs and curses him and his mother and treats them like they are dogs.
When I was a kid, my mother used to do all this blame game, cursing and hitting to my grandparents. They were very depressed about it.
If I or my late-grandparents tried to call her out for this behaviour. She acts total maniac and threatens to call the society or police and give fake misinterpreted complaint about us.
She never apologizes nor considers anything she did was/is wrong. It's always their fault and this is how she acted.
Everywhere she goes she complains about every other person in the room. How they talk, why are they so friendly, why their wear this, why they always jokes around etc etc. She calls herself the best and looks down on other. Literally calling every other person a slut or characterless.
She forces and manipulates she to do things for her and then complains about it was me who did it and completely denys her part in it and there more to it... I could write pages of her mistreatment I, my father and my grandparents had suffered.
After all this, I'm mentally tired and routing for an escape. If I stay any longer I would probably end up k11L1ng myself. I need peace and happiness in life. I was never a extremely outgoing or extrovert person nor I ever did something that got them in trouble. I need a peace of mind and I can't deal with this anymore.

She always tries to make herself seem better than everyone else. I always thought I was the only one who saw this in her and never directly told anyone about it. There have been past situations that make me feel this way, but I digress.
On the day of the wedding I was, of course, super stressed. We had a problem with our catering service. Thankfully we got it all sorted out. After the ceremony I went to go see Sophia and some other friends. I was shocked when I saw her wearing a white dress. Yes, it did have some flowers on it, but still! It was enough white to be too much. I was pissed. I quickly pulled her to the side and told her to get the hell out.

No. I feel like I also kicked her out in a good way, I didn't scream at her or make a big scene. But I don't know, maybe it was just the previous events or stress that made me feel this way.

Last week an old buddy of mine called me out of the blue. For context on our relationship: We were friends in high school, and sort of drifted apart in the latter years. When we both went to university in different cities we met maybe two more times and that's about it. These last ten years there were maybe 5 or 6 text conversations, all went nowhere. So imagine my surprise when they called me for ""not super fun reasons"" and if I could maybe meet up in our home town. I lived there again, so I agreed since they sounded kind of upset. When we met up in our old favourite bar it turned out their dad was terminally ill, and they'd been at home for a week already. So of course, I tried to offer a shoulder to cry on, but it seems they mostly wanted a distraction, so we just talked about whatever all evening. This monday I got a text that sadly the father passed away, and if I maybe wanted to go to the funeral or wake? I gave my condolences and said I'd try to get a day of from work, but I couldn't make any guarantees (only with direct family you're always allowed to take time off for this type of stuff in my country). I couldn't get a day of, but I'd of course make time for the wake the evening before to offer any sort support I could. I got a text back asking if maybe I could get half a day off, so I could still meet their current my name they told me about last Friday? I said I couldn't, but again stated I'd like to be at the wake. Yesterday I texted them again asking how everything was going and when/where everything was. I got a semi-joke answer and nothing actually useable. Am I an asshole if I just give up asking and go do something else tonight? My partner already said ""so just because they're bored and in need of a distraction they call you, drop this on you, and then leave"" (I'm not the strongest emotionally, and was just a depressed mess all Saturday). But I still feel awful about possibly just leaving someone to themselves when they've just lost a parent.",,t3_1gr58uv,AITA

I work at a hotel on the reception and the kitchen is on a separate floor to the desk, on morning shifts once breakfast is over for the guests one member of staff goes upstairs to get breakfast for themselves and whoever else is on the desk as we can't also leave. This was the new guys first morning shift and because he didn't realise of this unspoken rule I didn't get chance to eat. After I told my boyfriend this he said he didn't like the idea of another guy bringing me breakfast and said it was intimate, I tried explaining to him that it was not a personal thing and just something staff to do for each other because we're too busy to take separate turns.

thoughtfulfirebouqet,AITA for not giving the neighbors kids candy?,2024-11-13T15:03:20.188000+0000,3627,264,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqev2l/aita_for_not_giving_the_neighbors_kids_candy/,"I, 21f, live with my parents in the Netherlands. Here we have a tradition on November 11 called Sint Maarten. It's where kids make their own lanterns, go door to door, sing songs for candy. Kinda like trick or treating. In my neighborhood we have the rule that the kids (and their parents) can only come to the door for candy between 6 and 7pm. No sooner and no later. It's also a rule that the houses who participate, need to have a candle outside next to the door. No candle means no songs/candy.
Now we have new neighbors (they moved here 6 months ago, but this is the first time they participated here), with 4 kids between 9ish and 15ish so of course they were welcome to participate.
Now I was home alone during Sint Maarten, because my parents were with my aunt, who's really sick. I was really busy with my projects for college, but between 6 and 7pm I happily put a candle next to the door and prepared a bowl of candy. Many kids came to sing songs and it was adorable. At 7pm I blew out the candle, grabbed the rest of the candy to snack on (there were 3 pieces left) and went back to my projects (I had a deadline that evening).
Around 9pm the bell rang. I opened the door and there were the new neighbors. The kids immediately started singing songs. I didn't know what to do and when they were done I politely told them that the planned hour for Sint Maarten was already over. The mom said that they couldn't participate then, because absolutely couldn't miss her tv-show and that her husband was grocery shopping.
Now I'd like to point out that we have a group chat with all the adults in the neighborhood and each year the rules are repeated. These new neighbors are also in this chat.
I told them that it wasn't my fault that they had other priorities and that I didn't have a candle outside. The mom told me that because I had the decorative lights above the front door on, they assumed that I was still participating. I explained the rules again and told them that it had to be a candle outside the door to prevent confusion.
She asked me if I was really going to deny her kids candy after they sang me a song. I told them that we didn't have anything left and she got even more mad. I pointed out that even if I had any left, I wouldn't have had enough for all her kids.
She demanded that I go find candy for her kids, when I told her that the best that I could do was some fruit, she scoffed and said that I had ruined Sint Maarten for her kids. The kids started whining for candy and the mom told them that I didn’t have any for them
In the meantime it was almost 9:30, my deadline was for 11 and I still had a lot to do. I was tired, stressed and had a headache, so I was grumpy. I still tried to be as polite as possible and told them that I had to get back to my project.
The next day there was a message in the group chat from the mom saying that her kids were disappointed that they couldn't participate and that she expected better from a neighborhood with so many kids.

RequirementFluid4437,WIBTA for abandoning school without telling my parents?,2024-11-14T22:42:03.461000+0000,9,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grhg5p/wibta_for_abandoning_school_without_telling_my/,"I'm currently enrolled in University and pursuing a degree in computer science, where I was placed by the govt. My dream course is Medicine and my parents are well aware of this. My Dad made me join this Uni . I had resisted strongly and fought against getting admitted into this uni to pursue a course I do not want but my Dad basically forced me to ...he literally said "" If you don't wanna study you might as well say so"". I hadn't applied to any med school yet because we hadn't even had this conversation.So his reasoning was that I should just get admitted because I hadn't secured any admission into med school yet and med school is generally very expensive and we ""can't afford it"".
The fees are high but I know what my Dad earn and I can say he will be able to pay my tuition, though uncomfortably. I haven't mentioned my mum because she earns way less than he does currently so my Dad has the biggest say since he's the one providing finances. I feel like my Dad doesn't want to pay for my tuition despite his capability.He has genuinely always been very stingy and provides the bare minimum (I'm not kidding lol) He literally tells he doesn't owe us shit anymore because we(his kids) are all 18+ and the constitution does not bind us to him anymore. We've always felt like he's a sponsor and not a Dad- a sponsor who's always mad that he's got dependants.
It's almost the end of this semester, and I've hated it here. I've had no motivation to attend classes and CS is also kinda hard. My parents had mentioned that I'll just leave this place and do medicine next year 'if we get the money' and I should just persevere in the meantime. I feel like this is an excuse so that I can find myself completing CS here. I have kept insisting on us having a meeting to plan on how we'll get resources to pay my tuition if what my dad claims is true , but they keep pushing the meeting away. I feel like my mental and emotional state, as well as my aspirations are being ignored. My dad is throwing problem statements about funds but is not willing to have a meeting to discuss solutions for them. He wants me to stop whining like a little bitch and just suck it up. My mum wants me to stay at this Uni too but I still think the longer I'm here, the more I'm cementing my stay and completion of this unwanted degree. I can't trust them with ""when we get funds you'll transfer"" when my dad has blatantly refused to buy me a laptop even though he's very capable of buying one. I mean how do I even study computer science without a fucking laptop?
I'm gonna defer at the end of this semester without telling them and then focus on applying to med schools so that I get admitted in September next year. I can't focus on CS. I'll do whatever it takes to study Med. So all this being said, WIBTA?",,t3_1grhg5p,AITA

Because of this I kept my door open to my friends and their family who were less lucky. I had no issue until my friend who we‘ll call Joe (m, 25) came with his gf Emily (f, mid 20s). I have two cats, an older cat who stayed under my bed the whole time and a 1 year old who loves people. My cat was out and about giving kisses and jumping from lap lap but if you pushed her off she was good about just moving on. This became an issue as Joe is allergic to cats, runny nose and red itchy eyes type of allergic. He didn’t bring this up until I noticed him avoiding my cat and asked if he was ok which is when he told me but that he didn’t want to be a bother. That he ‘knew I had cats and still made the choice to take up my offer.‘ I told him it was no bother and offered meds and to lock my cat in my bedroom. Joe insisted it would be fine just as long as she ‘wasn’t crawling all over him.’ The rest of the people over kept her occupied and Joe just has a few sniffles. I offered a few more times to lock up my cat but he insisted it was fine and I had already done enough. Emily was quiet and made no effort to keep my cat away from Joe if she came near. Fast forward and I was at a BBQ with Emily and Joe. The topic of Beryl comes up and Joes makes a joke about how thanks to me the hardest part for him was ‘having a cute cat right in front of him that he wasn’t allowed to pet.‘ Emily is glaring a he says it.
Someone asks if she’s ok and she just goes off on me. That I was ‘cruel to force Joe into an allergic reaction when they were all already suffering‘ that ‘I didn’t even care about helping people since I was so willing to put someone between being out during a hurricane or anaphylactic.‘ Joe is standing there with a look I could only describe as gobsmacked. Another friend mentions that I offered to lock my cat in my bedroom multiple times and that Joe insisted it was fine. At this Emily starts again that of course he did because ‘who would tell me to lock my cat up when I was already helping them and that I should never have even asked and put him that situation. That the gracious thing would have been to just lock both my cats in my car while everyone was over.‘ At the idea of locking my cats in my car post hurricane my heart sinks and everyone gets more upset at Emily resulting in a huge back and forth. One friend accuses Emily of ‘not doing anything to help Joe’ and that she could have asked me to lock the cat up if she felt that strongly. She shot back that shouldn't have had to because she ‘wasn’t the host and I should have been more respectful and on top of things like that.’ After a few minutes Joe snaps out of his apparent shock and drags Emily away apologizing for her and insisting that he had no issue, it wasn’t that serious and is still grateful. Emily finally leaves but yells out again how ‘cruel I was for putting my cats above everyone else in need.’",,t3_1gqllw7,AITA

During the summer I bought a lot of new clothes since I was starting sixth form, and I'd have to wear my own clothes rather than uniform like I had in lower school. My sister is in her 2nd year of 6th form and has worn all her clothes so wants to wear mine.
Since September she has been nagging me, but I haven't been comfortable with her wearing a top I hadn't worn to school yet.This may seem selfish, but the 2 times I'd worn her clothes someone has asked me if 'it was my sisters'. I don't want her to wear a top I haven't worn yet, since I don't want somone asking me if its my sisters when it's mine, thinking its her hand me downs. I don't want to be embarrased wearing my own clothes. She is older so has never experienced something like this, so doesn't understand where I'm coming from so thinks I'm selfish. I'm 90% sure my parents think this too, but aren't getting involved since I bought my clothes with my own money. My parents are both the oldest don't understand the embarrasment of wearing hand me downs, or being recognised in your older sisters 'clothes'.
Moving on, I told her she could wear my tops once I had worn them at least once. Last week that time had come, she wore my top and I was ok. But then she went to wear another top a few days later. I feel like she doesn't understand its my closet and sees it as an extension of her own. Idk why I'm just annoyed. I don't mind her going into my closet every once in a while but its getting too frequent, it may not seem frequent but I barely go into her closet. The other day when she came into my room again to go through my closet, I asked her why she couldn't wear one of her tops, it was a genuine question, although it may have came out wrong. She was offended and just left my room and began acting rude.
I may be the AH here but I think 2 days ago, I was clearing out my room and gave her a top that I didnt want at the time, mostly because there was no space in my closet. 2 hours later I went and took it back, I had told her but she claims she didn't hear me. Today she went into my closet again and found the top, I explained the situation and she was fine with it and said she would wear it today.The problem was I hadn't worn it yet, so I told her and she got upset. I kept asking her all day if she was ok but she said she was fine.
1 hour ago my dad came into my room, and asked me if I had a problem with my sister. We talked, but he was convinced I'm lying to myself and that I don't want her to borrow my clothes. I don't mind but I just don't want it to be a frequent thing. He started basically saying that I was jealous of her and that siblings can start to hate eachother. He bascially implied I was jealous through metaphors.He said I had until he went to sleep to tell him what I wanted to do about the situation and to be honest. He also said I was bad with communication and things I say could be taken badly.

We met via a club and have continued that on through different sports. She rode horses which I wanted to do too, yet she was born into it. So she was looking for a new horse, because her old one couldn't enhance her ability any further. She didn't make any effort to talk with me, and only showed ads for horses she found, which she knew I was struggling mentally because of my parent's financial situation, which meant I couldn't even take lessons. I asked her to stop, as it just made me upset, but she said I was being insecure. She finally bought one whilst I was playing a game with a friend. She joined me and wanted to talk about this new horse she had gotten, but I wasn't interested. She later messaged me saying to grow up and be happy for her, and then blocked me. I felt extremely upset, but she was exhausting me. Prior to this she had also said she was busy and didn't want to text, and wanted to revise for her GCSEs. Although as soon as a position for a club leader came up, she applied, and said she would be there every time. Now this was a very active club, which I actually ran. I mentioned how she was busy, and had to revise for GCSEs, and her response was that she could make time. So now after she blocked me, probably 4 months later, she unblocked me and asked for forgiveness. I stupidly accepted it and she wriggled back into my life. Fast forward she's still the same old person, always criticising me. She also made inappropriate jokes with a guy 4 years older than herself. I was sitting at home and she texted me and asked if I wanted to call and play a game with her, I said sure and we hopped on. I am the type of person that you either love or hate. I have an excitable personality, always making jokes and giggling. She was being very quiet, and as soon as we came off the call she put her status to ""That one person that makes you want to rip your hair out<<<"" I can only imagine it was towards me. I didn't mention it, and just kept it to myself. Fast forward to her birthday, and I said there was ""that girl"" that we didn't like. It came to around 2 pm and she said something along the lines of ""This friendship is over. You haven't even wished me happy birthday. How could you forget MY birthday? I thought we were best friends. Apparently not."" And she blocked me, after I said sorry. I am also a very sensitive person, and very in tune with other people's emotions. She then continued to talk to her friend about me personally, and she humiliated me in a public space, spilling all of my secrets, that I told her not to tell anyone else. Her friend was backing her up, which I had no one. I have been quite riled up by it all, as she didn't even see me as a friend, and expected to wish her a happy birthday. But I feel like it's a bit deeper than that. So, AITA for not wishing her happy birthday?",,t3_1grsvwt,AITA

I’m currently working 2 jobs, 5 days a week. I’m also a full-time student, so my other 2 days are taken up with being at school for 10-12 hours. I’m in my senior year of my degree as well so it’s a heavy course load and I’m also applying to grad school and internships at the moment. All 7 days of my week are occupied with either work or school, and I have to wake up between 5-7 am everyday. I’m barely home, but when I am home it’s spent doing homework, eating, and sleeping.
My boyfriend finished his degree a couple years ago and he is working full time, 4 days a week. Outside of that, he goes to the gym about 5 days a week, every Friday night he goes bowling with his friends, and a couple days a week he plays a card game with his friends.
At the start of the semester, we agreed that he would take on most of the chores, but I would help when I can and I’d still help with dinner because I enjoy cooking. He sometimes complains about having to do the chores and will ask me to help out with things here and there such as cleaning the cat’s litter, and I’ll do it. We both hate cleaning honestly so I get it’s annoying, but I’m starting to feel frustrated when he expects me to help with more chores.
In my eyes, we agreed on this beforehand and he was completely okay with supporting me. He also has 3 days a week that he gets to sleep in and he’s able to go the gym and have hobbies. I’ve been stressed because I don’t even have the time or mental capacity to make doctors appts that I need, and I had to stop going to the gym a couple months back. I don’t have the luxury of having time for myself, not to mention my body is physically sore as both my jobs also require me being on my feet all day.
AITA for getting frustrated that he expects me to help with housework too or am I putting too much on his plate? Does this sound balanced/fair?
Update: Thank you for both perspectives I needed it! To answer some questions:
-We split the bills evenly, I also have car payments hence why I needed a second job to help cover it. One of my jobs is also relevant to my field and I need it for my resume.
-My schedule is my choice to an extent, I’m going into a career in healthcare and the current school load is required, I don’t have any flexibility there.
-I work 40-45 hrs a week, he works 40.
-As someone said, we both see it as him supporting me towards my goals, and ultimately we want a life together, it was an agreement for our future.
-We do errands together, I still help with dishes and laundry regularly. I’m cleaning the floors this weekend and he asked for help cleaning the bathrooms as well.",,t3_1gr5odq,AITA
SuggestionMedical736,"AITAH, if I don't want to go on vacation with my friends because they try to micromanage the expenses?",2024-11-13T10:42:02.543000+0000,5828,1743,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqa3vi/aitah_if_i_dont_want_to_go_on_vacation_with_my/,"I (30m) have a group of five friends from university who are around the same age as me. For the past two years, we've gone on vacation together—first to Mexico and then last year to Egypt. We've always had a great time, and we get along well. However, when it comes to sharing costs, I find myself struggling. It's not the group that has an issue; it's me who has the problem.
To provide some context, we all met at university nine years ago and have been working for the last five years. Our university was ranked number one in the country at the time (though I no longer keep track of the rankings), and we all landed jobs just a month after graduation. I mention this to illustrate that we are all financially secure; I know for a fact that each of us earns between €80,000 and €100,000 annually.
In terms of vacation costs, I typically spend around $3,000 for each trip, which is more than my friends spend since I’m more comfortable with spending. Additionally, I'm aware that the vacation money we receive amounts to at least double what any of them has spent on these trips.
So this is the problem I have: every night, they ask for a check, start checking off items for everyone, and then make that person pay exactly that amount. To me, that's embarrassing: getting nasty looks from the waitress who doesn't make in a day what these people make in an hour, waiting there for ten to fifteen minutes while they argue about who had what, and then starting to count bills and coins to pay.
I suggested we split the bill five ways, but they don't want to do that. They have mentioned that I'm the only one who drinks alcohol with dinner and that it's not fair if they have to pay extra for it. We are talking about maybe two euros. I even offered to pay more, but they still refused because some are not big eaters and don't think they should pay extra for others. It's four vs one. To make matters worse, they spent every night comparing Uber bills because, maybe I paid a couple of euros less for the ride...
So now they are planning a trip for this year, and it could be the last one as some of them want to start families, but I'm thinking of saying no, I can't do this anymore. I enjoy our trips, but getting a pay request of three euros because I had a couple of glasses of rum someone else bought at the supermarket at our hotel messes with my mood.
But I'm also the only one who has a problem with this, and I want to ask if I'm the asshole or if this is just a really strange way to handle finances.
Edit: People keep asking why we don't ask for separate checks, and the answer is that most places we visit refuse to split the bill into five. Also, some people think I want them to pay for my drinks at dinner, but I have offered to pay for my drinks, even if we split the bill.
Edit 2: People keep asking how drinking alcohol is only a couple of euros more expensive. It's because while I drink a beer or two, they drink Coke or some other soft drink. So, at the end of the day, I had two beers, and someone else had two Cokes. Yes, the beer is more expensive, but only a couple of euros compared to the Coke.
Also, some people think I'm a big eater, but I'm not the biggest eater in our friend group. I take ADHD meds, and if you use those, you know what it does with your appetite. Also, my share of the bill is always one of the lowest unless we stay long and I drink more, but again, I offered to pay for those drinks myself.
Edit 3: People keep asking why I don't pay the whole bill and then split it later. I suggested that we try it. But then that night, people started arguing about who had what, and there were items on the bill nobody said they had ordered. So they went back to do it at dinner so there would be no discussions about who had what.",,t3_1gqa3vi,AITA

Even-Dot3889,WIBTA if I got a kid’s parking pass for high school revoked for running the red lights of my bus?,2024-11-13T23:41:55.240000+0000,432,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqr4uz/wibta_if_i_got_a_kids_parking_pass_for_high/,"edit: thanks everyone, definitely filing both reports you made me feel a lot better about it. I was very likely going to anyway but I have effectively no guilt in doing so.
I’m a school bus driver, specifically a mini bus for special education students of varying levels of ability.
I was picking up a student this morning, and a car with two kids neighbor kids in it was stopped at my reds going the other way. Apparently loading my student and getting them buckled in was taking too long for their liking and they just decided to go while the red lights were still flashing and stop sign was deployed.
I asked my boss what the procedure for this was and she said there’s a police report to file but not much usually comes of that but since it was kids at the school we service their parking pass will get pulled.
Normally I’d be 100% for fuck around and find out, you’re breaking an important traffic law that is literally in place to save kids’ lives, but the only thing that’s kind of hanging in the back of my mind is that what they did literally wasn’t dangerous, just illegal. My student was already on the bus and we were at the very end of a cul de sac so there wasn’t any other form of traffic at all.
I was given the paperwork to file once I had the license plate, which I will easily get since I see this car every day, but it’s very unlikely my boss will follow up on what was a pretty quick, informal chat, so it really is pretty much up to me what happens here.
I’m feeling kind of guilty because it’s only November and that’s a long rest of the school year for a senior to have to take the bus.",,t3_1gqr4uz,AITA

I was 12F, I went to girl scouts, (about 6 girls) for a White elephant exchange, instead of getting a gift, opening it, and someone taking it or getting the next gift, we all got gifts and opened them, then traded. We didn't have a choice. Everyone had a 30-50 dollar gift. The host said the gifts should be about 20-30 bucks. Guess what the gift from the hosts daughter (that the host herself bought) was? A 2 dollar necklace and a 5 dollar gift card to crumbl cookie. (That place makes me really sick) So, sure I was upset, everyone got something I'd like and I got that. I didn't show it though and continued on. I asked EVERYONE if they'd trade. Everyone said no, so I give it to one of my friends. And immediately one of the girls' I asked if they wanted to trade traded it from the girl I gave it to for their gift. So I got nothing and that girl got two 30$ gifts even though I asked everyone if they'd trade me? Out in the parking lot I got sad when my mom came to pick me up, we went to our vehicle, away from the other girls so they wouldn't hear, and I told her what happened and I cried a bit.

We occasionally go out and party but recently Grace has been consuming an excess of alcohol to the point we have to chase her around because she won’t listen to us. We have also found out that she has started drinking wine before bed and drinks whole bottles of wine by herself. An instance occurred where she signed up to be a sober monitor at a tailgate and drank regardless because she “needed to drink” that day. After talking to her casually about maybe limiting her alcohol intake, nothing had changed so me , Maria, and emma decided to have a talk with her about it. We were at our dining hall and Grace was talking about how she “loves how our friend group can be blunt and talk about things”. We then said we had something to talk about and she insisted we discuss it here and now regardless of us saying to talk about it in private. We then told her “we think you are going down a dangerous path with your alcohol habits” and that we were pointing this out because we care about her health and want her to not get physically hurt. She said that she has been really stressed recently and she knows alcoholism runs in her family. She then said “I can’t be here with you guys anymore” and left.

It's going to be a small ceremony at my grandparents’ house. I know it’s kinda late to be talking about dresses, but I was originally planning to wear my stepmom’s wedding dress. It’s a beautiful dress that I love, and it means a lot to me because she’s the one who raised me and loved me when my bio mom didn’t want me.
But here’s the thing: while planning the wedding, I got pregnant. I’m three months along now, so I’ll be six months pregnant at the wedding. The dress from my stepmom is tight-fitting and there’s no way it’s going to fit a six-month baby bump. I was devastated, not because I’d have to buy a new dress, but because I really wanted that special mother-daughter bond on my wedding day.
Last weekend, I was venting about it to my MIL, and I broke down crying. She then said she’d be honored if I wore her wedding dress. She showed it to me, and it’s a stunning vintage dress from the ‘70s with a boho/hippie vibe, gorgeous embroidery, and funnily enough, she was pregnant when she wore it too. She made me feel so loved and welcome, so I accepted.
The issue is, my MIL has a daughter (my SIL), and when she found out I got the dress, she was furious. She actually came over to my house trying to take the dress back, and even said I was “living in sin” for getting pregnant before marriage (??). My fiancé just kicked her out and told me not to worry since she’s always thought the dress was ugly and never wanted it.
Still, she and my FIL have been harassing me on social media and through messages. Even though my fiancé and MIL don’t care what my SIL thinks, I kinda feel like a jerk because if my mom did something like this, I’d probably feel a bit hurt too. So, AITA?",,t3_1gqeq37,AITA
LongNo9349,AITA for not making space for my sister to sleep?,2024-11-14T19:25:55.270000+0000,11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grcxsr/aita_for_not_making_space_for_my_sister_to_sleep/,"Hi everyone. As the title suggests, that is my question. Without context, it really does sound ITA, but here's some background story.
My house is currently under renovation. My sister and I are living in different rooms. Today, her room only got repainting done, which left an uncomfortable smell of paint and led me thinking that she might want to sleep somewhere else, like my room, for the night.
I offered her that as soon as she got back home around 11pm, and she agreed.
Because tomorrow, my room will be done next, I got 2 items on my bed (backpack and a bag of necessities) lying on the rear side of the bed. When my sister went into my room, she also sat by the rear side of the bed doing her thing, while I was working on school assignments. After about an hour, I decided to take a short nap/break before continuing working on the assignments. That was when I headed to the bed and lied down.
After that nap, I woke up. My sister got upset that I didn't make space for her to sleep. I was kind of dumbfounded, because there were 2 reasons. My bed had enough space for the 2 of us. Before the renovation, there was a time when I had to stay in her room. I was the one who had to ask her which side of the bed would she like to sleep on. Now, she got upset or mad that I did not make an effort to do that. Her reasons were:
I did not make space for her on the bed = I don't want her to sleep in my room
the situation before was much more different than this, and the way I handled it was inappropriate. Before, there was nothing on the bed, while this time, there were my 2 things on the bed. Additionally, she told me that I was aware of staying in her room in the old situation, and this time, she got a last minute offer.
I'm not sure if she is sensitive/gets offended easily about everything or I am actually an asshole.
How should I deal/solve this situation?",,t3_1grcxsr,AITA
vicariouslv,AITA for sharing my insecurities with my best friend?,2024-11-15T00:15:01.261000+0000,5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grjg6f/aita_for_sharing_my_insecurities_with_my_best/,"My best friend (F21) and I (F22) have been close for almost a decade. Over the years, I’ve always felt a bit intimidated by her because she’s always been more confident, while I’ve struggled with self-esteem. Despite this, I’ve always been happy for her, especially since she’s had her own struggles.
Earlier this year, I started hanging out with an old high school friend who introduced me to her group of friends. As my old group started drifting apart, I invited my best friend to hang out with them, not wanting her to feel left out. My new friends were nice to her, and I made an effort to include her.
I can struggle with being possessive in friendships, though I never let anyone see it because I know it’s unhealthy. I pour myself into my friendships and often feel I don’t get the same back, which is fine, but it would be nice to be treated the way I treat others.
As my best friend bonded more with my new friends, I began to feel uneasy. This feeling came from a past experience when one of my oldest friends ditched me after getting close to her boyfriend’s group, which was traumatic for me. So, I started feeling anxious that the same thing might happen with my best friend and my new group of friends, even though they'd given no reason for me to think that.
One day at lunch, my friend noticed I was acting off and asked if something was wrong. I told her I didn’t want to talk about it, but she insisted, so I confessed that I felt uncomfortable with her getting close to my new friends. I admitted that I struggled with changes in friendship dynamics, but I didn’t want to seem possessive or jealous. She seemed to understand, but the next day, while hanging out with our new friends, she laughed and said I was jealous of her new friendships.
This hurt me because I felt she had broken my trust by bringing up something I had confided in her. I called her out, but she argued that she hadn’t said anything false. I ended up backtracking, probably because I felt ashamed, and we apologized to each other.
Then, last week, I found out through other people that she had been chatting with a guy we met at a bar. We usually share everything about boys, so I was surprised she hadn’t told me. That night, I joked about finding out from other people, but it wasn’t meant maliciously. She later apologized, saying she hadn’t told me because she feared I’d be jealous.
She told me that our earlier conversation about jealousy had made her self-conscious, which left me confused. I clarified that I wasn’t actually jealous about her flirting with a guy, and that my concerns had been about our changing friend group dynamics. We talked it out, and she apologized, but I’m still left feeling upset.
I feel torn because I think I might have made things more complicated, but at the same time, I think my friend has been insensitive to my feelings. AITA?",,t3_1grjg6f,AITA

We have been friends since grade school and sadly drifted apart when she went to grad school in South Carolina (we lived in MA) and I stayed in our city. During those years apart I found my current partner (33M) and couldn’t wait for my BFF to meet him. After she had graduated she chose to practice in the south for one more year before she moved back up home. For context, not a lot of our friends stayed in our city so I had made new friends. This is where it’s become difficult. Since she has returned she’s always insisting on going out to bars & clubs to find men and will say that I’m the perfect wing woman since I’m taken. I’ve always been super uncomfortable with this because I don’t want to disrespect my partner or our relationship SO I’ve been able to get out of a couple of those crazy nights and just settle for 1v1 dinners during the work week. Thus, my partner hasn’t been too thrilled with her existence since she’s returned. I had some coworkers host a St.Patty’s Day party at a local bar and since my partner was working I brought my bff. From the moment we walk in she clings onto an intern (25M) and they’re basically all over each other for the entire night, which clearly caused some work drama for me but oh well. They loosely date for almost 6 months with going to dinners, sports games, and it sounds serious from my bff’s pov. Then they break up since his internship is done and he’s moving on with another company for his career. Since then it’s been many phone calls, texts, FaceTimes, and in person meetings where she gets to vent and I’m fully present to listen, which I happily did to be there for my friend. Now it’s been 2 months and she’s still not over it. Even to the point when I lost my job while in the process of buying a house she didn’t acknowledge my grief but went back to hers.

However something I was looking forward to were these Labubu: Have A Seat dolls from Pop Mart. They are these little plush keychains with. vinyl face, and they come in blind boxes so you don’t know which one you are going to get. However Pop Mart barely rereleases their items, once in a while they drop them again by surprise but they sell out pretty quickly. I was lucky enough to find a full box set of all six of the characters from the Have A Seat set. Also it was a treat for myself since I haven’t collected dolls since I was a kid.
(This next part you might want to Google Labubu: Have A Seat to visualize what they look like, since I’m not allowed to post pictures on this subreddit)
The three dolls I really wanted from that set and couldn’t stop talking about when I was with my family were Dada (the pink one with heart eyes), QuQu (the mint green one with eyelashes), and Zizi (the purple one with the sleepy eyes).
I have a little brother in middle school who said that he’ll take HeHe (grey one with the scrunched up eyes) cause he’s not too big on Labubus, nor did he who what they are but he was curious about it. I also didn’t care for giving HeHe away, since I wasn’t too crazy about them, but then when I opened all of them and he saw QuQu he told me he wanted it. I established my boundaries saying that we already talked about it and I said I would get QuQu, Dada, and Zizi, while he would get HeHe.
Then my mom came in and told me to give QuQu to him. I tried to establish my boundaries again telling her that I have been looking forward to having those three, but she still kept insisting that I give my brother the green one so he “has a nice toy too” and if I didn’t want to give her up I would have to sacrifice either Dada or Zizi. I tried to get my brother to take Baba (the light brown one with big brown eyes) instead, but my brother said: “No, she’s ugly and you already have all the pretty ones.”
So just to shut them up, I gave up the green Labubu, but I was still kind of upset about it over dinner causing my family to go on a tangent about how I’m “selfish” and a “spoiled brat.” My mom asking: “Why are you so greedy?” Then my dad then decided to randomly vent his built up frustration he had towards me because my job and internship hours interfere with my brother’s extracurricular activities, saying: “You always think the world revolves around you!”
I feel kind of stupid for getting upset over this, cause it’s just a hunk of cotton and plastic. I didn’t know why I was getting so emotional over a stupid doll, but I don’t think it’s really about the doll, it was about my boundaries not being respected. When I clearly said: “No you can’t have it”, they kept forcing me until I gave it up.",,t3_1grr2y8,AITA

For some context, I (18F) left my country to go to Uni a few months ago and that's where I met my friend Maria (fake name) 19F. She and I immediately clicked but one thing that always bothered me in her personality is that she always feel the need to touch people. I don't like that for personal reasons and made it clear several times that she stops for a few days and starts again because she ""forgot"".
Now to the actual problem: Last Tuesday, I wasn't feeling ok (because I was trying to find a way to ask her, again, to give me some space from a physical pov without being rude or mean) so I kept to myself and her attitude just made me feel overwhelmed. I barely spoke to her during our class and as soon as we got out, I put on my earphones to listen to my music. She tried to talk to me but I immediately told her that I didn't wanna talk and intentionally left a different way because I didn't wanted to be mean. About 4/5 minutes later, I saw her again in front of our uni (which makes sense because we had a class together) and just hoped that she would leave me alone. She did not. In fact, she started walking next to me, so close that I could feel her shoulder against mine. I slow down, she slows down, I speed up, she speeds up. To go to the building where we had our class there are 2 different ways: Take the stairs and go around the building from the left or go straight and go around the building from the right. I always go straightforward and she always takes the stairs, but I noticed that she didn't seem to walk towards the stairs, so I slowed down and went towards the stairs from behind her, and she followed me. So I changed my route again and took a few steps back to the direction I usually go, she followed me once again. I was honestly pissed that she wouldn't leave me alone so I took out one of my earphones and said ""Can't you just leave me alone??"" before walking away without listening to her answer.
Later that night, I sent her a text where I calmly explained (once again) why I didn't wanted to be touch and why I reacted like this, she left me on open and didn't answered until this morning with a text in which she basically blames me for everything and asks for an apologie.
I dont believe I am in the wrong for asking her to respect my boundaries and I believe I stayed polite (maybe a bit cold) in the text I sent her. I dont know what to do since she's been ghosting me, amd I cant even talk to her face to face because she hasn't come to class for the past 2 days. Some of my friends said that maybe I was too hard on her or too honest. AITA in this situation?",,t3_1grct2k,AITA

I said there are many derogatory words about my identity that I could reclaim but if someone was uncomfortable with me using them, I would stop because I find it disrespectful to do otherwise. She said that’s just my opinion and she doesn’t think it’s disrespectful to use a word that someone it doesn’t even apply to is uncomfortable with.
It’s not as if I told her she shouldn’t ever use the t-slur, just not when she is around me. But I’m cis, so maybe she’s right because I’ll never understand what it’s like to be trans, and especially not her experience with the word.",,t3_1gs2qa1,AITA
Coconut_Throwaway182,AITA for kicking my little brother out of a conversation I didn't want him to hear?,2024-11-14T22:15:15.046000+0000,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grgusa/aita_for_kicking_my_little_brother_out_of_a/,"Sorry for any errors, not a native english speaker.
My brother (13M) and I (17F) attended a weekend camp with many of our friends and community members (all in highschool). At camp they are very lenient about the rules, and we are allowed to stay up as late as we want, so long as we stay indoor bc there are animals outdoors at night. We all went outdoors anyways, but that's beside the point.
My brother is the youngest in the friend group by 2-3 years. He basically got adopted into the group bc he always used to hang around me and my friends, and eventually he became friends with all of them. They all love him dearly and treat him as an younger brother, and I don't mind at all, because he doesn't have any brother or many friends besides these so I think it's good for him.
At this camp it was late at night, possible 2am, and several of us, maybe 6-7 people were outside by the docks. Yes breaking the rules but it's fine LOL, literally nobody gets in trouble at this camp. We all started talking about our parents, childhoods, and traumas. It was amazing conversations and we were all able to connect with one another and support each other. I cried a few times, it was some really personal and deep shit that everyone was sharing. Some people starting asking me questions about my past and I wanted to answer, but not with my brother around. When I was younger, I did a lot of bad thing. Drugs, alcohol, selling my body, etc. I was only 12-14 at the time, so around my brothers age. My parent's know about all these things, but my brother only knows a little bit of the story. I do want to tell him the whole thing, I don't want to hide it, but I know he is not ready right now. He's been protected by my parents his whole life. The stuff I had to go through, he never went through. he's really naive and very emotional and sensitive. And he looks up to me a lot, so I really don't think it would be good for him to hear my story yet. When he's older, for sure.
So, I told my brother to go inside to the main lodge. There were other friends of ours in the lodge playing games and singing karaoke so he wouldn't be alone there. He didn't want to go but I insisted. My friends thought he was okay to stay but he ended up leaving. After that I was able to talk to them freely, and after hearing me my friends agreed that it was best that my brother didn't hear all this yet.
We all talked a bit more and then decided to go inside to the lodge. When we went in there were only a few people left and my brother looked really hurt from being left out. I sat next to him and tried to explain but he didn't seem to understand where I was coming from. I felt so bad, he looked really hurt.
We're back home from camp rn and things are back to normal, it seems. The two of us and hanging out and talking like normal, but I'm wondering if he's still hurt (doesn't seem like it?) or if I was wrong and whould apologize. AITA?",,t3_1grgusa,AITA

Ok-Number-970,AITA for trying to encourage my bf to not risk losing his job??,2024-11-15T01:41:29.362000+0000,3,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grl6mm/aita_for_trying_to_encourage_my_bf_to_not_risk/,"This sounds fairly straightforward and I thought it was too until he got mad at me.
Relevant personal background: I have Asperger’s/ASD so I struggle with understanding if I violated social/relational rules and stuff. I do my best to keep the basics in mind, but when it comes to stuff like this I’m totally lost on if I messed up or not.
I (21f) was talking to my partner (23m) on the phone and he mentioned he couldn’t hang out that day because he’d be staying late at work to prepare for a corporate visit.
A little background: He is in a management position at a retail job, and his department is incredibly neglected as far as delegated hours go. He has a history of working off the clock just to cover his ass so he doesn’t get chewed out for stuff not being done. And I don’t mean staying a few minutes late once a week. I mean like 14hr days every day only getting paid for 8hrs per day. Recently HR approached him out of nowhere right at his off-time and told him he’s off the clock and to go home. Since then he’s been by the book not staying late unless it’s approved.
Until the other day.
So I say “hey I understand you’re stressed about this but it’s really not a good idea since they’re investigating you for this. It wasn’t a good idea before and it especially isn’t now. I know they’re gonna complain but they complain no matter how much work you put in so you might as well just go by the book and try not to lose your job over this.”
He said “I understand.” But then proceeded to be completely silent for the next 20 minutes. Silence on phone calls isn’t abnormal for us because we’re both introverted and like to just vibe and do our own thing while on the phone. But I could tell he was upset so I brought it up again like “hey what’s wrong? What’s on your mind?”
He said he made a decision and didn’t appreciate me arguing with him when he’s just doing what he thinks is best. I explained I was only trying to look out for him, but then things escalated. I felt like he wasn’t listening to me and he felt like I was nitpicking his choice.
We sent a few texts back and forth (at this point the phone call died off) and I became exasperated and accused him of being emotionally unstable. I recognize now that it wasn’t right to say (and most certainly wasn’t the right time to bring up) but up until that point I really don’t feel like I’d done anything worth it becoming this huge.
So I take an hour or so away from my phone and when I come back to message him “I love you, I’m sorry. Please let me know when you’re home safe.” I found out he’d blocked me. I couldn’t even find his user account (we primarily message on social media since SMS isn’t always the most convenient).
I messaged him on a different platform to ask what’s going on and he said he needed space. I’m bewildered and confused and idk if I’m actually in the wrong here.",,t3_1grl6mm,AITA

I have been apart of a friend group for about 3 years now and M was in our circle for about 2 years. She dated one of the guys in our group M17 for about a month, but he recently broke up with her in September. Since then neither me or her have really spoken or hung out with our circle of friends as much. Today during our lunch period she was making up a quiz she missed. During that time I ran into the old group and decided to catch up and walk around the campus with them. I didn’t think it would be a big deal because two weeks ago she said it was okay if my boyfriend and I wanted to all hang out together. Well it wasn’t okay. She messaged me and asked why I was with them (her ex was there. I saw the text and looked around for her, when I found her she shoulder checked me and ignored me. I spent a hour trying to explain that I wouldn’t have talked to her ex and the group if I knew it would hurt her and I thought it wasn’t a big deal because she said it was okay and I have a boyfriend. She responded by saying I hurt her, and that she wouldn’t ever do this to me. After a lot of back and forth I just said she put me in a bad spot where I had loose all my friends because of her one month relationship or lose her which seemed unreasonable to me. She blocked me after I said that. Leading up to now I have gotten about 8 different messages from her friends saying she is talking shit and I need to work it out with her. So I guess I’m just wondering AMITA or is she making it a bigger deal than it is?",,t3_1grfrvn,AITA
Due_Instruction_76,AITA for accepting a paid writing gig from one of my friend’s old situationships?,2024-11-16T01:43:30.382000+0000,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gscitb/aita_for_accepting_a_paid_writing_gig_from_one_of/,"Recently I was approached by someone to write a feature-length screenplay for them for $3k. As someone who’s unemployed and is trying to break into the film industry, of course this seemed like a phenomenal opportunity for me. Unfortunately, the person offering me the job is a former situationship of one of my best friends who felt very much hurt and betrayed by this guy, taking a bit of time to heal from it all.
Earlier in the year I went to this guy’s party and that led to a big argument between my friend and I. I did tell her about it beforehand in an attempt to get their blessing, and I was told it’d be fine to go to his party. Unfortunately, things were actually not fine and she was quite upset that I went, saying that I should’ve known how it would affect her.
Being offered this writing job recently, I approached her again and was met with a begrudging “I don’t like it, but do what you gotta do”. Obviously not the best reaction but I thought it being a paid gig made a world of difference. However, in the last few days my friend has become completely distant, telling me they’re extremely hurt and humiliated that I took the job, and that I again, should’ve known better. I am beginning to think she’s about to end the friendship which really hurts me as I feel quite frustrated by this lack of communication.
EDIT: Another factor to consider is that I still live at home with my parents at the moment. Also, I've told her I won't take the job but it seems as though the damage has already been done.",,t3_1gscitb,AITA

RunExtra5267,AITA for wanting my sibling to share their happiness with me? ,2024-11-15T04:26:55.595000+0000,0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gro8z5/aita_for_wanting_my_sibling_to_share_their/,"I (23F) have an elder sibling whom I’ve always been very close to. We grew up in a functional family, and I was always taught to treat my sibling with the same level of respect and love I would give my parents. I shared everything with them, no matter how embarrassing or how much trouble I might get into, if my sibling told my parents. I never kept anything from my parents or my siblings though—I’ve always been pretty open and emotional.
Recently, my sibling got married, and everything changed. They stopped sharing things, which I understood; they were married and had their own private world. But then I started feeling like their spouse was deliberately trying to distance me from them, almost like I was a nuisance whenever I visited their house. It felt like my sibling was paying less and less attention to me, and I could sense that the spouse was influencing this. At first, I blamed myself. I thought, ""What kind of sister feels jealous of her sibling’s spouse?"" I kept telling myself that I was just being negative or overreacting. I did try to briefly talk to my sibling about how I felt, but she didn’t seem to take it seriously.
Today, my mom told me that my sibling is expecting a baby. This news hit me hard, not because I’m not happy for them, but because it felt like my sibling had deliberately excluded me from sharing in this joy. Everyone on the spouse’s side knows, but I had no idea. My sibling didn’t even think to let me in on this huge part of their life.
I’ve always imagined that my sibling’s children would feel like my own—like we would be a close family, and I would be involved in their lives. But now, I feel like I’m being pushed out. It feels like I’ll become an outsider, like the bond we once had is slipping away. This baby will grow up with the spouse’s family as the primary support, and I’m afraid I’ll be left out of it all. This baby will be the last straw. And I will somehow feel resentful towards this baby. But that would be wrong.
To make matters worse, I’m not in a great place mentally, and my family doesn’t really know what I’m going through. So, part of me wonders if I’m just overreacting or reading too much into this situation. But if I’m not overreacting, how do I deal with this? How do I handle feeling so left out and disconnected from someone I used to be so close to?
Edit: After seeing the comments, I realized that saying, ""I’ve always imagined that my sibling’s children would feel like my own,"" comes across as a bit creepy. I apologize; English is not my first language. What I meant to convey is that I want to be close to my niblings so that they can depend on me for support, similar to how I would support my own children. I didn’t intend to imply that I want to be involved in every decision they make; I'm not interested in that since they have their parents for guidance. I had a great relationship with my father’s brothers; they were really cool and provided me with a lot of support. My father was never concerned about this because they always respected boundaries. I hope what I'm saying makes sense. And with my sibling, if something happens, I also thought it would be us against the world, I never thought marriage could change that.
These are my feelings, but I never really thought about whether my sibling was okay with this; I just assumed we understood each other. I always believed that sharing everything about your day shows trust and love, but maybe I was wrong about that. I'm afraid to talk to them because I think it will be a serious conversation, and I don't want to ruin their happiness or take away any attention from what's important now, the baby.
I really appreciate your comments. They help me see my situation from a different perspective. Thank you for being gentle in calling me the ""YTA"" and for explaining your side instead of just insulting me.",,t3_1gro8z5,AITA

The thing with me is that I always match energy but also love celebrating with family because we’re not close anymore (some stuff happened on both sides and members picked and chose who to believe.. yea ik..) anyways I was very adamant on making the party invite only and I made a post on Facebook saying how it’ll be invite only so tough shit. Let me tell you what led to this decision; last September we baptized my daughter and of course celebrated I invited few members on my side and a lot of members on my bf side and out of like all the aunts, uncles, and cousins I invited from his side (which is like at least 30 people in total) only one aunt and her family (total of 4 people) actually came. So in my post I said “if you didn’t make the effort to come to her baptism then I’m going to assume you can’t make it to her 3rd birthday celebration” also I should have said this in the beginning in the Hispanic community the 3rd birthday celebration is like a mini quinceneara that’s why it’s a huge deal. The reason why I’m asking if it’s petty is because I have a lot of his family members on Facebook and I know for a fact they may contact either MIL or my bf about it.

My best friend is also unemployed and had time so I asked him to go on a trip with me to see the match since we both can take those days.
The thing is, I didn't ask my GF first if she wanted to go because I knew she had to work and assumed she couldn't do the trip without asking for days off which at the moment she can't take.
When I told her she got upset and after asking a few times she told me it bothered her that I didn't ask her first if she wanted to go with me. She told me that even if it's true that she could not go I should have asked her if she wanted to go first, instead of going directly to my best friend.

My (28m) sister Jenny (20f) went through a very rough patch mentally after Covid ended. Her therapist and doctor suggested she gets herself an emotional support animal. At that time, Jenny was still living with my mom, but has since moved to a different city for university. She lives in a flat there and usually comes home during weekends.
Back then, I suggested a dog to Jenny because it also gives her a reason to get out of the house daily, but she decided to get a cat. Don’t get me wrong, the cat is very sweet and I like him, but the issue is that my wife (28f) is VERY allergic to cats. To the point where medication doesn’t work and she can’t breathe if she’s in a closed space with a cat. Furthermore, an allergic reaction leaving long-term consequences on her throat would mean the end of her career (she’s a singer). Since we live and work abroad, we can only visit our families maybe once or twice a year. So, she couldn’t visit my home town for a couple of years now. My mom and my wife have a great relationship, but they obviously don’t see each other as often as they would like. Paying 80-100$ for a hotel per night in the only hotel in town also isn’t an option in the long-run, as we want to save up for a house.
My other sister is also affected by the cat, although not to the extreme extend we are. When she (30f) was pregnant, she told my mom she wouldn’t bring her child and partner to her place if the cat remained at mom’s because BIL is also allergic to cats. After she gave birth, they visited mom on several occasions, since they want their daughter to have a relationship with grandma. BIL sucks it up for the sake of the little one, but he sneezes almost constantly and has a runny nose. This is somewhat alleviated by medication, but it’s still a struggle for him as far as we can tell.
My mom (55f) also seems irritated by the cat now because she would like to travel and visit us abroad but can only do so for a couple of days because of the cat. Cat hotels are expensive and we can’t afford them for extended periods of time. My mom also doesn’t want to inconvenience my friends to watch the cat when she is gone. It bothers her, but she won’t say anything to Jenny to keep the peace.
I suggested that Jenny should take her cat to live with her at her flat. I think it’s unfair my mom has to bear the burden of having to take care of the cat during the week just so that Jenny can snuggle with it during weekends. My older sister also agrees and tried talking to her about it but this always leads to her crying and shouting. We are all exhausted but feel like we shouldn’t let our partners suffer because of a cat. So, AITA for suggesting that she takes her cat with her again?",,t3_1gqzxaw,AITA
Idk-w_2_name-me,AITAH for avoiding my childhood friend and best friend ,2024-11-15T02:43:52.026000+0000,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grmdk8/aitah_for_avoiding_my_childhood_friend_and_best/,"So I (17 F) am struggling in what to do. I am apart of a friend group that all like and respect each other, we never cross each other’s boundaries and are always with each other. Our friend group is really large and has a very diverse set or personalities. My childhood friend (17 M), who I have known for roughly 12-13 years and my best friend (17 F) who I have known for 5-6, have started hanging out more often, I ofc didn’t think much of it as we are all friends and hang out separately from time to time. 2 weeks into the last term of the year I started hanging out and reconnecting with my middle school friends as I hadn’t spoken to them in a while, I’d spend every other break and/or class with them and just talk.
From this I had learned that my childhood friend had been bad mouthing me, saying I had “ruined a 12 year friendship” and that I was “distancing myself from the group”. For context a couple weeks prior, I had gotten a bit upset at him because he was making inappropriate comments to our other friend (16 F) regarding some older (18-19) boys. She had decided she didn’t wanna deal with it and stopped being friends with him, from there he kept bringing it up even though he was told by teachers and others to not bring it up. She had asked me for advice and I had taken her to a well-being staff and she talked about it with me next to her. From this she told me he later apologised and that it was sorted out. To which I left it alone and didn’t bring it up.
According to several people (not apart of the original group) had heard him constantly mention the whole situation and say that I was “acting this way” because of it and that he was badmouthing me. After finding this out I went to my next class with my best friend and had talked to her about it, as I was upset and would usually talk to her about things like that. From this I later texted her that night apologising since they were friends and she had said before she didn’t wanna be apart of “drama”. She had given me a really weird reply (in my and others opinion) saying she didn’t wanna be apart of drama and she didn’t like people talking bad about friends as she feels likes she betraying them and just thanked me for apologising. I had left it at that and went to school the next day, where I had emailed my year levels well-being leader to talk to her about the whole situation as I didn’t know what to do. At this point the only person that I had spoken to about this situation was my best friend and my mother (and the people who had told me about him badmouthing me, but they don’t really talk to him unless he starts the conversation).
I went about my day until the first break when I was with the rest of the group just talking when a girl (17) that I hadn’t even had a proper conversation with, came to one of my other friends and told her that “if I don’t stop talking s**t, she would punch my head in”. From this point I instantly knew that my best friend had told them about my small rant. I went straight to the vice principal (he is normally the one who deals with threats of violence and fighting) with my other friend (17 F) who was apart of the group who told me about my childhoods friends badmouthing. I could not find the principal and at this time I had started to tear up. None of the other well-being staff were at the school or available at that time so my only option was the middle school well-being leader, he however was on his way to a meeting and gave me permission to sit inside a room with my friend and send him an email detailing what had happened( I had also cc’d my mother into it).
I then spent my next class (which I had with my best friend) in another room with my middle schools friends trying to figure out how to move forward. I had gone to the toilet and was stopped by another leader who my childhood friend and the girl who threatened me had gone to, to complain about me “s**t talking”. From this I mentioned the email and forwarded it to her. From this point I spent lunch in the same room and then went to my last classes. I then went home and talked to my parents about the situation and I had decided I did not want to bring the group into the situation because I didn’t wanna make people choose sides. My bf knew I was avoiding the two, however doesn’t know why and respects the fact I don’t wanna talk about it.
At some point I caved and talked to my friend who was not apart of the group and had her own differing opinions about the two. She was good to talk to and didn’t tell anyone else and I appreciate that. My “twin brother” ( we look alike so we always joke that we are twins, we have convinced most of the teachers😂) had noticed that I had left the group all of a sudden during one of my breaks, he asked me about it and I told him I was avoiding someone and left because they showed up (both of them). That same day my best friend say next to me during class and tried to talk to me, I gave her simple replies and focused on my work ignoring most of her questions. I had gotten a glimpse of her laptop to see she was chatting with my childhood friend and were talking about me and how I had left during the break.
The well-being leader I had originally emailed then got back to me (she was sick for a couple of days and couldn’t work) saying she could see me, from this I told her the situation had worsened and now more people were involved. I have a meeting set up during one of my breaks to get advice and talk it out. However the last time I talked to a well-being staff ( they had moved to another school) I was forced to have a “restorative meeting” where the staff and the other party just chit chatted the whole time. So I’m a bit nervous that it may happen again.
Another thing to mention is that my “twin brother” had figured out who I was avoiding and point blank asked me if I was avoiding my childhood friend. From this I folded and told him everything. He agrees that I’m doing the right thing for not getting others involved and splitting the group and just avoiding the two until I can talk to someone else. But I’m not entirely sure if it truely is the right thing. I told him I don’t wanna go up to them as most the time when I do, I get accused of going up to people to “fight” or “yell” at them. As I am known to be confrontational when it comes to my friends ( I have in fact protected my best friend several times through confronting bullies or other people). Do I am waiting for them to come to me, however I do not see that happening.
So am I the AH",,t3_1grmdk8,AITA
CjYonder,AITA My Brother-in-law Played Video Games on my wedding day,2024-11-14T22:15:42.194000+0000,2,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grgv5q/aita_my_brotherinlaw_played_video_games_on_my/,"So just as quick backstory me(20m) and my now wife(21) decided to get married on Leap day of this year. We went through a lot of couples counseling beforehand so we knew what we were getting into so we just decided that instead of playing marriage we would actually get married. Anyways for my groomsmen I had 4 of my really close friends who I have known for a while and then I had my now brother in-law(18m).
We did our rehearsal and then did the whole rehearsal dinner with my huge family and my wife's small family. The whole wedding party sat at a long table facing our family so talking to each other was kind of difficult, but we managed. That night as I'm going to sleep I get a message from my soon to be sister in law(24) saying that my brother in law felt really unwanted and left out at the dinner and I need to make an effort to include him. I get pretty annoyed at this, but say something along the lines of ""I definitely will, sorry that he felt that way, I'll do what I can"". I message the other groomsmen so they are aware to include him more and many of them told me that they tried talking to him, but he just wasn't interested.
Next day I am running around doing all the last minute wedding things so my wife didn't have to deal with anything and after that its picture time! I have a blast taking a bunch of fun pictures (and serious ones too of course) with my groomsmen. Afterwards I hand the photographer a little gift I made for my wife to deliver to her(I only handed it to him and no one else). ThenI ran off to help out the guy who was doing our music figure out something really quick and when i come back my groomsmen and some of the people who arrived with them are all running around looking for my brother in law. No one knew where he was and he hadn't said anything to anyone. I call him, no answer, so queue 30 minutes of looking for him. I checked discord as a last resort and see he is playing Forza. He arrives about 5 minutes before the ceremony. Besides that the wedding was great. Later he says I told him to bring the gift to my wife (uh, heck no I didn't) and in the wedding photos the photographer took a picture of him playing said game.
He also dropped out of my bachelor party the morning of by his mom messaging me saying he was sick(He was playing forza). It was a group fund that we paid for ourselves, but because he dropped out (along with 3 other people within 48hours) I had to pay an extra $480. He has never mentioned anything about it to me.
Whenever he is approached about a difficult subject he clams up and refuses to talk so there's nothing I can do about it. I have not forgiven him for this, nor has he apologized either. I try not to treat him any differently, but I have invited him to very few things/ feel the need to include him in a lot which is now being interpreted as me pushing my wife's family away.

So I live in a terrace house that I own and someone rents the a joining house next door. Shes just had a baby and the baby's room shares the wall with me and there is also 3 massive windows 1m away from mine that are wide open all the time.
The baby cries every night multiple times between midnight until 5am. This has been going on every night since July this year. The crying wakes me up every single time as the baby is placed in a common space in that house (not a bedroom, her house only has 1 bedroom) and the windows are never closed. I understand babies cry and I understand being a mum is hard so please don't tell me that I have to cop it - it is absolutely driving me crazy. I have asked her through the window at these ridiculous hours to close the window and she still hasn't.
As a result, I'm showing up to work exhausted, losing focus and irritable. I literally am tired all the time because of this. I have tried earphones I've tried my aircon as white noise I have tried everything.
She's admitted to one of the neighbours that she knows the crying is waking me up every single time and every night, and it surprises me that she's not doing anything about it. I'm also a deep sleeper, and my sleeping app in the past has picked up random noises and I've never had my sleep disturbed until the crying. And the app has picked up the crying!
I understand that babies cry but at least close the windows or move the baby to an actual room. It's becoming insane at this point and it's not a case of me moving as I've owned this house for 25 years.
How do I ask her to close her windows or move the baby away from my shared wall without being insensitive to her situation?",,t3_1gqq1hq,AITA

One of my friends that is mutual friends with Nick it's starting to call me the asshole because she feels that I had no right to exclude her. I know the feeling of being excluded but nick had a whole melt down in the middle of class it just felt so immature of her.
After sitting on this for a while I'm starting to think I might be wrong.
But at the same time a lot of my friends who are involved in secret Santa really don't like Nick, she's had a habit of being genuinely annoying along with spreading false rumours behind peoples back.

I've decided to serve champagne, enough for each person to have 1-2 glasses, but have asked people not to bring any alcohol with them. This is because of my grandmother/mother's behaviour at my neices first birthday where they drank a lot, spilt wine on the carpet and presents and just bad behaviour all round. My mother doesn't have a great relationship with myself and my sisters due to substance and mental health issues and because of how her and my grandmother act when they get together when alcohol is involved, ive decided to only invite my grandmother who I have a pretty good relationship with overall.
However, she seems to be taking issue with me not allowing her to bring alcohol. I told her I'd 'probably serve some champagne' and the following day she rings me, again asking about bringing alcohol as she 'cant see herself going all afternoon without a drink'. I confirm that I will be serving champagne but don't want anyone bringing any. My husband's family aren't big drinkers and neither are the rest of the people invited. At this point I'm starting to get a bit fed up with the fixation on alcohol when it's about my son and dryly ask her if she's an alcoholic. She tells me 'no but I'm a drinker and I drink everyday, don't you know that?' and saying 'what are the adults supposed to drink, raspberry soft drink!?'.

so i got really upset,as i was her primary caregiver since i was a child - helping her with her epilepsy attacks,going with her to her chemotherapy appointments,when she had a stroke i helped her by taking her to the physiotherapy clinic and even did all the exercises with her at home. i yelled at her for being so full of herself to even think that acting out will make us stop whatever we're doing and bow down to her so we can be her servants.

now, earlier, she bumped into the table where i left my phone to charge and its screen protector, and the phone's screen itself got broken, and i told her to pay for its fixing. either, she takes it to the repair shop herself or she gives me the money. maybe, if she was not so mean to me and chose to simply erase my existence out of her mind like what im doing these past few months i would have chosen to close my mouth and js let her out of the bat (just like what ive always been doing!) but she deserves it. for once, im not gonna say it's okay and sulk afterwards when, in fact, it was not okay.
i can't even imagine how ive managed to remain 'friends' with her. im js glad im not anymore and that our 'bond' wouldn't be able to sway anymore.
(edit: i became too defensive ig and the bot told me to define my actions to be more asshole like so despite knowing so d*mn well that they're financially unstable, i insisted her to pay me. and im actually quite happy of the situation 'coz ngl ive been wishing for the worst for her and if this js ain't perfect?)",,t3_1gr2lfe,AITA
isik13078,AITAH for refusing help from my parents to look after their grandchild?,2024-11-13T12:08:50.003000+0000,795,213,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqbf46/aitah_for_refusing_help_from_my_parents_to_look/,"INTRO: First time mom here (30F). Husband works away from home for a few months, so I'm on my own for now. Our baby is 3 months old.
Lately the lack of sleep has been catching up with me and I told my mom I'm not feeling well to say the least and I should probably get couple of hours extra sleep. I have never asked for any help from anyone until now so it was hard for me to finally cave in and admit I need it now. It's also hard to even think about leaving my baby with someone else. So when my mom offered to sit with him for a few hours, I agreed but it would be best if he stayed at home where I was sleeping, so I don't feel anxious and can actually fall asleep. She agreed. They went outside to have a walk (we have a pretty big property). When I woke up two hours later, it was already getting dark, no one was inside the house so I went outside looking for them as I also saw the stroller wasn't inside. After 5 min looking for them and realizing they're not there, my eyes welled up and I started panicking, ran after my phone and called my mom (thankfully she picked up). Apparently she decided it was best for me they went to her house so they don't make noise and disturb my sleep. My dad picked them up. With no car seat might I add... Although it's only 5 min drive, but still anything can happen. My mom actually left a note but she put it in a really shitty place so I didn't see it and it didn't save me from panicking. When I went to them I wasn't angry, I appreciated the help and the thought behind their actions but I also explained why it wasn't best solution for me or my son. They didn't agree and still think they were right to do what they did and they know what I need best...
So because of this I am struggling even more to ask for help and leave my baby with them. It will take time for me to stop stressing and overthinking and fully trust them again. I explained this to them as I can't be sure what else they could be doing opposite of what we previously agreed to and they feel very hurt saying I'm hormonal and don't understand what's best for me. I agree on being hormonal but that doesn't undo what they did. Actually I expected them to be a bit more understanding of my anxieties but it is what it is.
So AITAH for not asking for/refusing help with their grandchild anymore for some time? Am I overreacting?
FYI: I would never restrict them visiting us and I will still take my son to visit them.",,t3_1gqbf46,AITA
PhoenixHeanix,WIBTA If I continue with my plan to study abroad despite my Mother's thoughts regarding it.

I (17M) am half English and half Turkish but I have lived in Turkey for my whole life despite basically being raised as a Brit thanks to my father even though I live with my mother; Yes, my parents are divorced, they have been since I was 6 years old.
Now, I'm going to be completely honest with you lads here, I fucking hate the everliving shit out of Turkey. Mostly because of how the people treat me, and the fact that they have voted for the same guy that's taken our economy and butchered it. Another main aspect is the intense governmental control over everything, most recently banning Discord etc.. And then with how some people treat me with disdain over learning that I'm not a muslim but that I'm an Orthodox Christian, they see me as a second class citizen, i've actually been beaten for it a couple times at my high school.
Anyway, sorry for the big rant there but the point i'm trying to get across is that I don't want to remain in Turkey any longer, and the easiest and honestly best country for me would be England. Mainly because i both have an English passport etc, and that it's my first language. And I already know what I want to study which is Law, so that I can further down the line become a prosecutor.
My father has been greatly in support of this plan, and has offered to provide financial help where and whenever he can, my mother however... has different thoughts regarding it, it is obvious that she is at the very least hostile regarding it, very recently we have gotten into an argument where she stated stuff like ""So, you are just going to abandon me?"", ""Most normal kids are fond of their mothers."", ""I raise you up for 18 years just for this?"" ""You are a narcissist"" and a few more that my tired brain can't remember currently.
Honestly? It's kind of left me conflicted, I think I am in the right however I don't want to let self-righteousness blind me. So guys, Would I be the Arsehole?",,t3_1gr26hw,AITA
Vast_Flamingo_2509,AITA for 'critiquing' my partners post about me when discussing the responses? ,2024-11-13T08:11:13.684000+0000,1646,335,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gq851z/aita_for_critiquing_my_partners_post_about_me/,"When I first met my partner ""P"" I was open about my friend ""F"" being someone that I had once had a casual relationship with.
F and I were just friends before and after anything sexual occurred, and it stopped happening on its own (we didn't continue until meeting other people or anything like that, we stopped and went back to just being friends).
I could tell that P wasn't super comfortable with this, but I knew they had bad previous experiences with being cheated on and also that trust is earned, so I hoped that in time (and with demonstrated faithfulness) this wouldn't be an issue.
I didn't push to maintain a friendship without P's involvement. One day a group of us went out for a drink, with P coming along and meeting these friends for the first time. P got along with some, but things with F were awkward. At one point, F was making some bawdy jokes. Not to me, just talking shit with the group at the other end of the table. P became very uncomfortable and spent the rest of the evening withdrawn and staring at the pub TV. I didn't speak up at the time because there were multiple convos happening and the jokes weren't directed at us at all so I didn't think much of it until later realising how withdrawn P had become.
After this point my friendship with F faded. We caught up one time when I returned an item that I had borrowed previously, which I discussed with P and they said it was OK, they didn't expect me to just drop it on Fs doorstep and bail without catching up for a bit. I felt that this was positive and showed trust, however any active friendship with F was pretty much in the past at this point.
Now, years later, F reaches out asking how I'm doing, hoping I'm well. I respond in kind, and F asks if I'd like to catch up. I bring it up with P before responding, letting them know that I'd like to. Thought it would be OK as we've had no issues with infidelity, and I'm sure that I've never given any signs that I would be unfaithful or anything like that.
Now the asshole moment. P posted about it on a support forum specifically for people with shitty partners. Words it as ""my partner suddenly wants to start hanging out with someone they used to sleep with, who has only ever been incredibly rude to me"". Then shows me the responses, which almost all say that I am clearly cheating, I am trash, throw me out. And now P is upset that I am ""critiquing their post"" when I point out that the wording would make me think that someone is cheating too, and the replies might be biased. I'm open to discussing the replies but I think it's a valid observation that affects the discussion.
P asked me how I would feel if it were reversed, and I told them that I would be absolutely fine with it because I trust them. P doesn't seem to believe me.
AITA for bringing this up and then ""critiquing"" the post that P made to ask for advice? I might be invalidating their feelings by doing so, but I don't know how to discuss the responses without discussing that part.",,t3_1gq851z,AITA
FarOutDude67,AITA if I don’t pay full rent?,2024-11-14T18:14:48.948000+0000,5,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grb95r/aita_if_i_dont_pay_full_rent/,"I moved in with my girlfriend approx. 2 years ago. She lived alone before I met her and she works in a reasonably well paying job. At the time I was in a reasonable career, together we earned approx £50ish k between us. We have always split the rent proportionally (% based on total household income vs your income so it doesn’t impact us unfairly).
I changed careers and started in a different field. I’m now on less money (£18k) whereas she has continued in her field and is now on approx 45k.
As part of my career I’ve had to move out to attend training in a nearby city. I get a stipend to cover part of the rent there and I go home for weekends. I’ve paid my share at her flat as it’s approx a week of the month total that I’m there
Well now I’m having to go abroad for a few months as part of my job. She wants me to pay more money as I’m not paying rent for my flat as I’m deployed. The issue is she wants to pay the rent agreement we’ve had in the past. Which means I’m paying rent for both her flat and my own. This would mean I’m paying the total amount that I’d be paying if I stayed at her flat full time as well as paying my own bills in my flat.
I don’t mind contributing some money to the flat as we have pets but I feel conflicted paying the full amount even though I won’t be there at all.
She feels she’s being punished for earning more money if I pay less. She thinks that we should be a family and I’m not seeing us as a unit. She feels that if I’m not paying while I’m training why would I pay when I’m fully qualified (when I’m on more than double current wage but still away from home to work most of the year). While I see her concern I think these are different as I’m having to pay double rent on current income whereas I’d only be paying one rent on more.
I feel like if I had never moved in to begin with, this wouldn’t be an issue. I feel like I’ve signed some agreement by moving in to begin with that I must pay in perpetuity. I feel like I’m simply moving out temporarily and this was and is her apartment first and foremost. She won’t be struggling to pay bills.
Additional info that may be relevant. We aren’t married. No kids. No mortgage. Pets. She has significant debt from her past that may be influencing her decisions.

Me and Sally’s interactions were a little short and shallow at first, but one thing that’s important to note that SHE was the one who initiated like 2 of 3 times. Eventually, we started having longer, more productive conversations, most notable of which was when we got on the same bus and I sat with her and talked to her about life, our interests etc. I was really trying to get to know her and she seemed engaged and not uncomfortable at all. But soon after, I noticed that she started acting avoidant. One time, after class I happened to be walking behind her and her friend on the way to the stairs. She noticed me, and instead of going down the stairs, she went UP which makes NO SENSE because the floor right above us was and still is undergoing maintenance, so she really had no reason to go up those stairs unless she had an objective which was to avoid me, plain and simple. Another time I was trying to say hi to her but she just straight up ignored me like I wasn’t there.. my voice was loud enough, I was in her peripheral, but she still didn’t acknowledge me (well to be fair, she did have headphones in but I think I was loud enough). Anyway, ever since then, I have started to avoid her as she ignored me, quite overtly actually, and she seems to have been doing the same. This has been going on for the latter half of last month and the beginning of this one (just saying this so we have a timeline). So, last week, something happened that POSSIBLY, MIGHT HAVE, REMOTELY disproven all the assumptions that I had up to that point. I was hanging out with her friends (who I’m acquainted with and have been acquainted with before I even met her ), and when she had to leave she said goodbye to ME, directly. So, I might be crazy, but doesn’t that mean she acknowledged my existence even though I thought she was avoiding me?? Was it all a big misunderstanding?? Is she bipolar???? Am I bipolar????? I honestly don’t know, and this whole thing has had me in a stupidly strong death grip for some reason (probably because I kind of like her, which is a fact I probably should have mentioned previously).

One of my bridesmaids was “Rebecca” (30F), who came with her longterm boyfriend, “Alex”. At one point during the reception Rebecca disappeared, having gone off into the woods with one of my husband’s friends, “Brad”. She was gone for a while - I think about an hourish. Alex, who knew no one, was looking around for her at one point, shortly after which she came running up to me crying, because Alex had come upon her and Brad in a compromising position. She told me that nothing had happened (seemingly a highly literal description of events from what I have since heard) but that Alex, upset, had smashed a beer bottle and left the wedding. Over the course of the night, she kept pulling me aside to talk about it. I tried to console and support her, despite not wanting to be occupied by this on my wedding night. She also got drunker and drunker and continued to flirt with Brad: dancing together, holding hands…everyone could see what was happening and kept trying to keep them apart. It was a whole thing. The next morning, she came to the post-wedding brunch - with Alex - where she again pulled me aside to speak to me about it. Apparently after Alex left the wedding, he drunk drove their car somewhere and slept in it - really scary stuff. I was totally supportive of her, however, while also being in the middle of my own wedding weekend with 100 other people.
Because I was so consumed with my wedding, I didn’t really contemplate her behavior at the time and it wasn’t until we returned from our honeymoon that it sort of clicked for me that I was upset with her. I sent her a message letting her know that I was ‘bummed out’ (the literal words I used) that she had behaved so carelessly at our wedding and hadn’t been more mindful of her impact. I crafted my message to her for a long time so that the tone was direct, but not overly accusatory - I was conscious of not wanting to embarrass her. We then had a couple of exchanges that continue to bewilder me: she said she was really hurt because she felt like I was judging her relationship with Alex; I shouldn’t be upset because she felt like she tried to protect me from it and hadn’t allowed it to ruin my day; she was mad at me because she thought my communication was tantamount to kicking her while she was down during a difficult time; she hadn’t said anything to me since because she was prioritizing her relationship with Alex, which she wouldn’t apologize for; and, eventually, she said she didn’t want to speak to me because she no longer trusts me and doesn’t feel safe. I called BS and said that friends are allowed to call each other out when they behave poorly, and that all I wanted was for her to acknowledge it, apologize, move on. But I have now not heard from her in over a year. I have a horrible pang whenever I look at wedding photos or think about her because she used to be one of my best friends and is now completely not part of my life. Do I have a blind spot?

I get to the garage and start filling as I was paying a older guy like late 50’s asked if I was the one that he saw on the way up he offered a lift back down to my car ok no problem I thanked him for the lift.
on the way down he got a bit weird in my opinion he offered to go to his house to get a can for fuel I have fuel enough to get to the garage so I thanked him for the offer but declined.
he then started to try turn off the road I said to him thanks for the lift but I’m this way if your busy I can just walk the rest of the way he locked the doors and said “oh sorry I forgot let’s get you back”
more small talk and he started to ask weird questions “does anyone know where you are” “where do I live” etc when we got back to the car I thanked him again and started to try get out
he said oh I live just down this ally let’s go down and get the van it’s heavy I will need your help red flag I told him I should have enough fuel to get to the garage.
I didn’t have a proper funnel so I used what I had but some fuel started to go on my hand.
so anyway I filled up and he says oh your hands are covered in fuel why don’t you come back to my house to wash your hands and I’ll put your coat in the wash real quick.
At this point alarm bells are ringing I said thank you again asked for his name and he started to look like he was thinking for a good 6-7 seconds before answering.
He then asked again am I sure I don’t want to come over to get cleaned up so I told him a little bit blunter look I really am appreciative but I have to go to work I’m sorry but I have to go.
I just thought weird guy till I told my wife about this and she said he might just be lonely and looking for someone to talk to and that I was a ahole to the guy who was just being nice but it’s still weird in my opinion.

When she asked me to be her Maid of Honor, I was thrilled and went all out to make her wedding special. I paid for the bridal shower, bachelorette party (a weekend trip), decorations, and other expenses, spending several thousand dollars. While it was a lot of money for my husband and me, I wanted to make her big day perfect because she’s like family to me.
Two months ago, I shared that I’m 4 months pregnant. Claire congratulated me but started acting distant afterward. She excluded me from conversations about the wedding and made passive comments about how “hard it is to coordinate” when people are “distracted.” I brushed it off, thinking it was wedding stress.
A few days ago, she sat me down and told me she didn’t want me in the wedding anymore. Her reason? I’m “getting too fat,” and she doesn’t want me in the pictures. She said she has a specific “vision” for her wedding, and I no longer fit it. I was devastated. I asked if this was about my pregnancy, but she insisted it wasn’t personal. She said she was replacing me as MOH with another friend who fit her “aesthetic.”
I told her if I wasn’t in the wedding, I wouldn’t attend at all. I also handed her the receipts for everything I’d paid for and told her she or her fiancé needed to reimburse me since I’d only spent that money as her MOH. Claire flipped out, calling me selfish and accusing me of trying to ruin her wedding. She said it was “tacky” to ask for the money back and that expenses like these were “my responsibility as MOH.” I reminded her that she removed me from that role, so those expenses were no longer mine.
Since then, Claire, her fiancé, and even her family have been spamming me with calls and texts. They’re accusing me of being petty and overreacting because of “pregnancy hormones.” They’re also saying I should’ve just let it go and written off the money because weddings are stressful, and Claire didn’t mean to hurt me.
My husband has been incredibly supportive and says I did the right thing. He’s furious at how Claire treated me and agrees that I shouldn’t be out thousands of dollars for a wedding I’m not part of.
I feel heartbroken and humiliated by someone I thought was my best friend. Still, the constant backlash has made me second-guess myself. AITA for standing up for myself and asking for reimbursement? Should I have just quietly stepped aside?",,t3_1gpvp1s,AITA

Now, usually my neighbor pulls up far enough that a car can fit in that spot, but on this particular day he didn't, so there was not enough room. Someone decided to park there anyways, which resulted in them blocking my drive way. I came home early from work, and was not able to park in my driveway. I drive a plug in hybrid, so I was not able to plug in to charge my car. My first thought was to call the tow-truck and have the car impounded, but my wife convinced me to just leave a note. I felt like the person (who ended up blocking my driveway from 8:00 am until 3:00 pm) would just throw the note away and go on with their life, so I decided to write ""F&%$ you"" in black sharpie on their windshield. I knew it would wash off easily, but I at least wanted them to experience some sort of tangible inconvenience for their actions. Basically, I wanted to punish them, and I thought that note alone would not accomplish that, no matter how strongly worded. My wife says I went too far, and I should have held back and just left a note. I felt like I was holding back by not having the car towed after they blocked my driveway.

Level_Construction94,AITA For Accidentally Outing a Friend?,2024-11-14T06:18:09.652000+0000,22,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqyl6k/aita_for_accidentally_outing_a_friend/,"All names are fake. Obligatory Throwaway, on mobile and long time lurker first time poster.
This is less of an AITA, and more of an asking for any advice you can give me.
Earlier today, some friends (14 - 17 M & F) and I (17M) were playing truth or dare. Through one of the truths, a friend ‘Jay’ (15M) revealed that he is Gay, but saying that he asked a guy out. A little while later (after some new people had joined) the following interaction occurred:
Me to Jay: “do you still like him?”
Jay: “Who?”
Someone else (I didn’t see/hear who it was): “The guy”
As soon as I say the word “him”, I realised what I’d done, and now I’m trying to figure out what I can do. I don’t necessarily want him to still consider me a friend (it would suck to lose him as a friend, but if he doesn’t want to be around me anymore I will respect that boundary), but I do need to figure out how to apologise to him. This is my last day of school, so I’m not going to see him in person again, and any interactions will have to be over the phone.
I’m also going to add, so you don’t think I did this on purpose/maliciously, that I am gay, and was outed.
TLDR: I accidentally outed a friend, and I can’t figure out how to apologise.",,t3_1gqyl6k,AITA

There was a couple sat opposite with a handbag on one of the two free seats. I asked the couple ""are these two (seats) free?"" and the male replied ""she's praying, in two minutes"" as he indicated towards the handbag. I asked the male (so as not to disturb the female who was praying at 2215 hrs) ""can you hold the bag so we can sit down then?"". He replies ""no, when she's finished praying"". I said ""so you can't pick her bag up then?"" and he said ""no."" I walked away without touching the bag or saying anything else to not cause an incident but I was visibly angry.

Weak_Living_6918,AITA for breaking my lease with my unmedicated roommate ?,2024-11-13T20:35:18.079000+0000,122,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqmtzh/aita_for_breaking_my_lease_with_my_unmedicated/,"I (24) and my roommate Sarah (25) have been living together for over a year. We originally had a third roommate, but when that didn’t work out, Sarah and I moved into a two-bedroom apartment six months ago. We share a bathroom, but her behavior has made living together increasingly difficult, and I’m feeling frustrated.
Sarah is unmedicated, does not go to therapy and has bipolar disorder, ADHD, and autism. While I try to be understanding, she often uses these struggles to justify her actions. She frequently frames herself as a victim and gets upset over minor things. For example, if I ask her to pick up toilet paper or if I’m on the phone at night, she can have emotional outbursts. It’s exhausting.
One issue is the bathroom. When we moved in, Sarah took over the entire under-sink area, so I used the bathroom shelves for my things. But she moved my items to the bottom shelf without asking. I texted her, saying it wasn’t fair since she already had the under-sink area. She replied with a long message claiming I was being unfair, which made me feel dismissed. When I responded, she accused me of disrespecting her boundaries, even though I was just replying to her message.
The kitchen is another problem. Sarah occupies most of the fridge, pantry, cupboards. She owns about 50 mugs (I have one), and at least 50 plates she doesn’t use(uses mine) but refuses to donate. I’ve expressed frustration about the lack of space, but she brushes it off. She also claimed I took over the coat closet, though we split it equally. Split down the middle.
A more personal issue came up when I bought two concert tickets for Sarah and me. She sold her ticket to my best friend when she couldn’t go, but later texted her saying she could attend and expected my friend to give the ticket back. My friend refused, and Sarah blocked her, claiming she was “bullied.” This sense of entitlement only adds to the tension.
Other boundary issues have come up as well. For example, I bought a sectional couch, and once, I was napping on it when Sarah came home and demanded I move so she could use it. Another time, I was on the phone at 11pm at night and Sarah pounded on the wall to make me stop talking. She also texted me at 1am, telling me I couldn’t turn on the bathroom light. I feel like my sex life is dwindling because if I sneeze too loud in my room, it’s an issue - let alone having a sex life.
I’ve asked Sarah to move her bed away from the shared wall, but she refuses, saying it would ruin her “aesthetic.” Every time I set a boundary or voice a concern, she accuses me of bullying her.
I’m reaching my breaking point. I have six months left on my lease, but I’m considering breaking it early. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, and it’s emotionally draining. I don’t think things will improve, and I can’t keep living like this. Am I wrong for wanting to leave?",,t3_1gqmtzh,AITA
Fig_da_Great,AITA For not paying my friend extra for getting me discounted meat ,2024-11-15T09:12:00.282000+0000,0,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grsfvk/aita_for_not_paying_my_friend_extra_for_getting/,"For a bit of background, my friend works as a butcher at Whole Foods, so he’s able to get meats at a reduced price. He has a flat 20% discount on everything, but sometimes he can also mark expensive cuts as ground beef, which allows him to get it for a lot cheaper. He offered to buy some meat for me with his discount, and I’ve started taking him up on his offer. Tonight, when he sent me the receipt, it showed a total price of $29.10, of which $9 was for chicken he bought for himself. After which the following conversation accrued and I don’t feel good about it. he’s a good friend I just think he’s a little clueless as to what he’s doing.
Friend: I got flank steak this time. Similar to skirt. Habaenro blend you might want to more evenly spread it again. So 2.2 lbs steak x 18 = 40$ 2.5 lbs chicken x 8 = 20$ I’ll give it to you 40$
Thighs are bone in skin on today This is non discounted price
Me: You got chicken for yourself?
Friend: Yeah the smaller one is for me
Me: I’ll pay your bill So your chicken’s on me
Friend: That’s 20$ of meat I saved you there
Me: Thank you 😊 1 friend
Friend: With 40$ Down from 60 You get 20$ in saving I get 18
Me: You’re asking me to pay for 40 for what you paid 20?
Friend: You said extra for ground beef price
Me: 20+9 is extra…
Friend: It would’ve cost 48$ for me without ground beef pricing. We should’ve established a rule if I did get ground beef prices. 29$ will work for this time.
Me: Sure we can make an agreement
Friend: How about So retail price. You’ll always be able to get the 20% discount If I do anything above that. For every dollar I save you pay me 50c more. So like Let’s say I got something for 50% of retail You’d pay no tax on the 20% discount but a 50% tax on the other part. Square deal!
Me: Counter offer: tip = ((retail x 0.8) - actual) x 0.3 30% of the difference between discount retail price and final price. I’m really not willing to do anything else.
Friend: 50-50. How is 50-50 not fair. 40-60. Compromise. Lowballing me I see.
Me: It’s fair in terms of emotionless capitalism. Unfair in that you’re trying to squeeze money out of a friend.
Friend: One could say the same of you
Me: Not really. The difference is I’m not profiting. And I’m actually putting money in your pocket Because I appreciate what you’re doing for me.
Friend: I’m saving you at least 20%. That’s money in your pocket.
Me: If this is going to be a whole thing, I’ll stop asking.
Friend: It’s up to you. Chicken gold egg
Me: Nah bro. I really thought you were doing this in a “let me help a friend out” kinda way and not a “let’s make some money on the side” kinda thing. I’ve rarely ever asked you for gas or parking money despite driving 99% of the time we hang out. I’ve paid for your food a number of times without the expectation I would ever get that money back. Unless there’s something I’m missing here, I actually find what you’re asking for quite insulting. I also don’t appreciate you trying to pressure me after I gave you a very clear boundary.
Friend: You were the one who suggested the extra if ground beef prices idea.
Me: Correct. That’s called generosity and appreciation This is greed
Friend: 20% discount easy. Ground beef not easy.
Me: Alright that’s enough. Goodnight
Friend: No hassle go to store. Pick up my house. Goodnight

freakymommy100,AITA my roommate wants me to accommodate my life at our apartment entirely around her OCD,2024-11-13T18:24:09.822000+0000,160,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqjopf/aita_my_roommate_wants_me_to_accommodate_my_life/,"Disclaimer- I apologize if this post is messy/unorganized/a lot, this is my first ever post on here!
I (19F) live with 2 girls in an apartment for school (22- F OCD and 23- passive aggresiv F).
My roommate claims she has OCD and says lights going into her room bothers her. I am not wanting to follow my roommates curfew rules of not being in the common area past 9:30 pm, specifically not having lights on at all in the common area past 9:30?? I don't mind her having OCD, and like that isn't the problem but she won't let me have lights on in the common area in the apartment that we all pay the same for. My roommates and I don't get along, they are mutual friends and knew each other before me moving in, and I moved in late so they had to make room for me. We have had problems in the past, but I have tried my best to move on and have still remained respectful even if they disrespected me.
I had gotten groceries late last night and had to put them away because my days are so long and I do not have time to do everything before 9:30 PM as a college student, and woke up the next morning with a sticky note (they did a sticky note because a week before I had left a sticky note on the fridge saying ""may we please make sure we clean up after ourselves"" because they leave crums out and grease all over the stove and its gross since its in the common area) on the fridge saying ""Reminder- no lights on past 9:30"". I just don't see it as fair (and also don't see the 2 sticky notes to be comparable because cleaning up after yourself is the bare minimum and expected as a roommate but having no lights on past 9:30 ever is impractical in my opinion), since I have not set any rules for them and let them do whatever they want bc I don't know them.
Each time we have had meetings they have both ganged up on me and are very hypocritical and do not take any blame for what they did and just accuse the other person. They claim I am being disrespectful because I don't want to abide by their rules set for me, but I honestly think no one has stuck up to them and they aren't used to it. In my eyes, I feel that if lights were such a big deal then she could have lived somewhere that accommodated to her needs. I use the dimmest of lights when in the living room and I don't want them to feel like they have power over me.
-i sent a message in our roommate group chat saying this and my roommate laughed at the message but claims it was an ""accident"": (below)
“in regards to the sticky note- it’s a little bit impractical to never have the lights on past 9:30 because i have long days where i’m out all day and don’t even have time to eat until i’m home or don’t have time to do anything till i’m back. i will try my best to be respectful of noises like i have been doing. we had agreed to not have the super bright lights on and agreed that the lights above the island were good, so i’ve been using those past 9:30. i pay just as much as y’all do to live here, so at this point i’m thinking that if there’s still a problem with lights on, then you should invest in something to help that (ex-there’s light blockers that you can put under your door) because i don’t know what else to do and it’s a common area for a reason.”
I thought this was very straight to the point and I am glad i stuck up for myself. ATP i think i will just live life in silence bc idk what else to do. I feel crazy but I don't think my argument is unfair at all. I am constantly stressed all the time and feel a hole in my stomach every time I walk into my apartment.

Secret_Specialist828,AITA for not being 100% present and invested in my partners venting,2024-11-14T06:49:35.823000+0000,16,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqz0w2/aita_for_not_being_100_present_and_invested_in_my/,"Hey Reddit, this is my first ever reddit post so I hope I did this all correctly.
CONTEXT: My (M25) and my girlfriend (F25) both work 45+ hours per week in restaurants. She is very extraverted and I'm very introverted. I've been told I'm not awkward but I've learned my social battery runs dry pretty quick. She is also a pretty big stoner, but in the past year I've stopped smoking except with her.
A couple of nights ago, we both got off work late after our closing shifts. She came over to spend the night and we talked and ate a quick snack. She wanted to smoke to help her wind down for bed, so we go outside to smoke. We start smoking and talking and we stay outside for atleast an hour. At some point in her venting about her day I pulled out my phone to scroll through social media or look at memes or something. She took it very personally that I was not invested in her story and still engaged.
In the moment, I felt a little attacked and caught off guard because that was never the intention. I guess from my perspective the only time I ever want to smoke is at the end of a long day to help decompress. Often when I get high, I stop being social and just want to turn my brain off for a bit. Especially at 1am after we had both just worked 10+ hours that day.
Almost this exact scenario has happened 2 or 3 times now over the course of months. I understand venting and how that can be a form of decompressing as well. I don't want to invalidate her feelings, but feel its unfair to expect me to be 100% invested in hours of venting. After a certain point it can start to feel draining.
Anyways I'm just a dumb guy, so hopefully Reddit will tell me if I'm in the right or not, or if we're just incompatible.. or whatever else it is that you guys do.",,t3_1gqz0w2,AITA
Cutiejea,AITA for not volunteering to help out in a family New Year's Holiday?,2024-11-14T02:44:44.188000+0000,33,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gquvej/aita_for_not_volunteering_to_help_out_in_a_family/,"Posting here was my boyfriend's idea as he too is tied to this as well.
Every year, my extended family hosts a Christmas and New Year's party, either at my grandma's house or a holiday home/AirBnb. Since my family lives overseas, I (26 F) will be flying back to celebrate with my extended family. This year will be the first year my boyfriend (29 M) celebrates Christmas with the family and I was so excited to show him my culture's Christmas traditions, plus see the crazy stuff that happens.
Sadly, this year is going to be different as not everyone is going to be around for Christmas, so the big reunion is going to be during New Year. My aunt announced plans to book a huge Airbnb to fit nearly 20 family members for three days and was doing a headcount on the family group chat. Something to know about my extended family is that each of them has a live-in housemaid who does all the cooking, cleaning, etc, and apparently, none of them are going to be around during the New Year season. Since no ""staff"" were tagging along, this meant that the Airbnb plans could be cancelled and we're just going to celebrate at my grandma's house.
Suddenly, my uncle had this ""great"" idea to have my mum do the work since my family had been doing our own chores for a long time since we left the country. Mum and I talked over the phone and she told me, my brother, and my boyfriend, to consider ""volunteering"" so we could do this Airbnb trip.
Here's where I (and my boyfriend) could be the asshole. When I told my boyfriend this, he was like ""HELL NO."" Not only was he opposed to work during the holiday, but he was opposed to BOTH OF US (and my mum as well) doing ALL the work. He saw it as the extended family asking the ones living overseas with no live-in maids to cook and clean for 20+ PEOPLE. And not gonna lie, I agree with him.
My boyfriend isn't opposed to helping out if it is just a few of my relatives, like my grandma, my family, and maybe a few aunts or cousins. But for over 20+ family members, most of which are adults btw, my grandma, and a baby, it's too much. It's free labor. Even if we're not paying a cent for Airbnb, we had to fork our own money just to fly back. So I told the family group chat that he and I would only volunteer under the condition that EVERYONE in the family (all 20+ members, except the baby and grandma) help out. I don't know if my cousins know how to cook and clean for themselves, but I've seen my aunts and uncles do it so it shouldn't be an issue.
So far, there haven't been any updates and the only people who have confirmed to volunteer are my mum and my brother, which is sad cuz, to me, it feels like the family is asking the ""foreigners"" or ""those who left the country"" to do all the work. No one has messaged me about changing my mind just yet, but usually, by this point, the plans for the holidays would have been set in stone by now.

Current_Gur_4336,AITA for doing the same project as someone else?,2024-11-14T15:28:04.765000+0000,3,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gr7ap5/aita_for_doing_the_same_project_as_someone_else/,"We had a project to do and I hated it. My group had every single one of our proposals rejected and so we had nothing planned. One of my group members (John) had a family member who worked in computer science so we decided that we'll work with them.
So during the time to work on the project one of the teachers, Ms Kate came up to us and asked us what we were doing for our project (this happened around the beginning of november, 3 months after we began the projects) and we talked about it and then she went to another group and asked what they were doing and they also said compsci (they apparently chose this months in advance) and then she told them that we were also doing a project on that subject.
So the other group started coming up to us and saying that they planned to do compsci and that we were encroaching on their thing but then their group leader (Sara) said it's fine and whatever. So we called our contact for the project (John's uncle) and we got confirmation to work with them.
The other group also went to call their contacts and by some twist of fate their contact was our contact (the school had given a list of contacts but we had no idea that John's uncle was there because it was under a different name). So they started saying that we are copying them and stealing their ideas and Sara says that I'm only doing this because she was talking about her project in class that day ( this was our backup plan for more than a month).
And she and her group started saying that we had no right to do that. I got angry and told my group that we should just change but most of them disagreed saying that we worked too hard to just throw it away.
So the other group brought their project advisor (Mr. Thomas) into this and the project manager — Ms Johnson (oversees all the projects). Mr. Thomas and Ms Johnson agreed with them saying that we couldn't  just steal other people's ideas.
So I explained to them that every project that we proposed was rejected and that we had no idea about the contacts (they didn't even know what they planned to do they just knew that it would have something to do with computer science). Then Ms Johnson asks me who rejected our ideas and I say that it was her then she goes:oh yeah. I remember rejecting that.
By then tears were already streaming down my face because I was so frustrated. Then our advisor Ms. Renee stepped in and said that we were not changing our project because we had been working hard on various things because we kept getting rejected (without real reason) and that it is frustrating
Ms Johnson just says that we didn't need to change our project and that I didn't need to cry for this (this project counted towards my GPA) and then she spoke with my advisor and left.  Ms Renee said that we should continue our work and that if they try to cause trouble that she'll deal with it
My group just kept telling me that we'll keep working on this no matter what they say.

Artistic-Wear-7150,AITAH - Not Attending Sisters Wedding,2024-11-13T14:23:51.555000+0000,284,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqe02b/aitah_not_attending_sisters_wedding/,"Back story. My sister and I are about 13 years apart. She was around 4 or 5 when I moved out of our parents house on my own. We've never really had a close relationship because of our age difference but she's my sister and I love her regardless.
Since she became an adult she has had little to nothing to do with me or my children. She doesn't invite us to anything, doesn't call me to talk, doesn't text. She's more like a distant relative and that's understandable because, again, we have such a big age difference. We are in completely different places in life.
A year ago she got engaged to her boyfriend. I've met him a handful of times and he seems like a good guy. They decided they wanted to get married in a different state on New Year's Eve.
During COVID, my family was practically homeless. We weren't always sure where food was coming from. It wasn't a great time for us and we went into pretty big debt just to survive. As things have turned around and we've started taking care of that I'm sure it looks good to anyone outside my family.
When my sister announced the wedding will be so far away I was determined to make it work. Your baby sister only gets married once after all (hopefully). I didn't immediately rsvp as I was still trying to figure out if I'd fly, drive, or both. Trying to figure out the most cost effective way to get my family to and from the wedding. It's a good 24 hour drive so would need broken into at least 2 days each way.
My sister apparently told my mom she was upset that no one had rsvp for her wedding on her side of the family. My mom called me. It became a thing. So I let my mom know I'd be there.
I'm currently working two jobs as we are working to chip away the Covid debt and my husband was laid off this past summer. Taking 2 days off to drive there, a day for the wedding, then 2 days off to drive back is at least 5 days of missed work. 5 days before New Years Eve is December 26th so we'd be driving on Christmas to ensure some buffer time.
My dilemma - in order to make this work my kids (one of which has seen my sister twice in the last year and the other not at all) won't get Christmas. All the money we've saved up for Christmas will be spent on gas, the rest of the Airbnb, and food for the trip. We won't have money to do fun things while gone, we won't be able to buy Christmas presents. It would strictly be drive 24 hours to the wedding, watch wedding, drive back.
Adding extra to this, my sister asked my nephew to be part of the wedding as a ring bearer. My kids have been an afterthought. No one has asked them to be any part of the wedding at all.
So AITAH if I don't spend my kids Christmas money to go to this wedding?
ETA: it seems this is relevant - the wedding is taking place on a cruise ship and everyone else invited has booked rooms on the cruise. We are the only ones who would not be cruising and would only be able to stay on board for the wedding.",,t3_1gqe02b,AITA

So I (21F) have a friend (21F), we can call her B. We are both uni students and she will be taking a class next semester that I’m currently taking this semester.
About a month ago, me and B got together and we had a little catch up about courses and I told her that I was taking this certain class. B said that she will also be taking the same class next semester, as it’s a requirement for her degree, and so I told her the structural details about the class so she can have some idea as to what it will be like. While I tell her these things, the most important part for this situation is that it’s an online class and the exams are also online.
B proceeds to tell me that I should take photos of the exams and send them to her. I was shocked and laughed it off because I thought B was joking. That’s textbook academic dishonesty/cheating, and I ain’t about that.
Fast forward a few weeks. Somehow the class is brought up and with a more serious tone she asks me AGAIN to take photos of the exams and send them to her. I say that it’s cheating and I won’t do it. B responds with “it’s only me who’s cheating, not you. And you should do this for your best friend. I would totally do it for you”.

My (24M) GF(23F) got back from the gym and texted me laughing if I've tried Orange juice mixed with Powered Milk before. I don't know if that's an actual drink people take but I found hilarious and quite gross too. I joked that it's absurd and what even gave her the idea to drink it. She laughed that I shouldn't even ask cause she doesn't know but that it aids in digestion. My GF suffers from indigestion from certain foods at times.
I asked her what doctor she heard that from as she takes a lot of medical advice from blogs online which worries me at times. She replied ""I have told you. If you like accept if you don't like don't accept"". I just saw that as her usual attitude and then proceeded to joke that ""she's drinking baby piss"" and added some funny stickers.
Then she got mad and now has refused to reply my texts. She's always been quite bad at taking jokes even though she makes jokes about me a lot all the time and I don't have any issues with it at all. AITA?",,t3_1grsyna,AITA
jume451,AITA for asking my wife for accommodations on difficult family travel?,2024-11-14T05:38:06.169000+0000,17,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqxycz/aita_for_asking_my_wife_for_accommodations_on/,"My wife is from China, I'm from Germany, and we live in the US. Her family lives in China, mine in Germany. We've been traveling together to see both families about once a year. When going to China we would usually fly from the US West coast to Shanghai and take a train to her hometown — a pretty direct route. We would also stay with her parents (at their insistence) in their small 2-bedroom apartment. During those stays I witnessed many a shouting match between my wife and her parents; her relationship esp. with her mom is poor.
We learned in early 2022, before China lifted its COVID border lockdown, that her dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (blood cancer). The following months she tried to arrange a trip to China, but flights were VERY expensive ($8000+). Her mom and brother were recalcitrant on bringing her dad to his scheduled treatments — ""We know your dad is going to die soon, why spend money on medical treatments?"" During this time my wife was suffering mentally a lot. In late 2022 Hong Kong finally allowed in visitors with 3 days of self-quarantine, so we booked a flight to HK, and she crossed the border into China from there. She spent 2 months with her parents and made sure her dad got to see all his doctors.
In Oct 2003 China had lifted COVID restrictions and we booked another trip. For good reasons that aren't relevant my wife asked for us to enter China from Hong Kong again, making for a much longer trip, but I agreed to this. Also this was the first time we agreed to stay in a hotel instead of with her parents because of the usual tensions now coming together with the emotional stress of her dad being seriously ill. This was my idea, but she did not argue against it and rather quickly agreed to it. We stayed 3 weeks, seeing her parents every day, taking her dad to Dr visits, before leaving in late Oct. At this point her dad seemed weak but stable.
On Jan 1 we get a call from my wife's sister that their dad had just passed away. We book a same-day trip to China (again through HK) to partake in funeral traditions.
Now, one year after our 2023 trip, we are planning a trip for the burial of her dad's ashes. Again we go over trip logistics, and we get into an argument. My wife says that I am too controlling about our travel logistics and that, really, she had preferred to stay with her parents during our 2023 trip because it was the last time she got to see her dad. I say that I was agreeing to the long route via HK, and that she had agreed to the hotel stay in 2023, and that we had gotten to see her dad every day, and that at the time we couldn't know that he would pass away so soon. To which she replies, regardless of all this, if I hadn't been there in 2023, she would've stayed with her parents rather than a hotel, and that I should have known her well enough to know this.
I'm hurt that she now uses my choice to accompany her to see her ailing father to accuse me of thwarting her final weeks with him. Am I the asshole?",,t3_1gqxycz,AITA
Consistent_Olive_604,AITA for refusing to leave a wedding because I wore a dress that looks white under a black light?,2024-11-12T17:22:48.903000+0000,16505,1533,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gpq0q8/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_a_wedding_because_i/,"A few months ago I attended a close friend’s wedding with my husband. I wore a YELLOW dress. Think like Belle in Beauty of the beast yellow. Bumble bee yellow. So yellow that I did not question if it was appropriate or not to wear to a wedding and neither did my friends nor family.
I arrive at the wedding, we have the ceremony, the cocktail hour, the dinner and the reception. I get many compliments on the dress and the bride even comments on how much she loves it several times.
Towards the end of the reception the venue dimmed the lights and turned on some blacklights. These blacklights made my dress appear more white than yellow.
A member of the wedding party approached me while the blacklights were on and stated that I needed to leave because my dress was “white” and “inappropriate.” I stated that the dress was yellow but the blacklights were making it appear white. The member of the wedding party stated that if i didn’t leave she would “make me.” I stated I’m here to celebrate my friend, repeated that the dress was yellow and said I will not be leaving early (bride and groom hadn’t left yet and I came from overseas). The conversation while heated, did not have raised voices or foul language from either side. But I will say it was tense.
The wedding party member walked off and I watched as they immediately went to talk to the groom, angrily pointing in my direction. The groom shrugged and continued to dance.
The next morning I was approached by a different friend at breakfast (not in the wedding party) who stated that they heard what happened and that I should have left when asked because it made people “uncomfortable” and that I made it about me “partying” rather than “respecting wedding etiquette.”
I have felt incredibly embarrassed about this since….so am I the asshole for not leaving the wedding when asked?
TLDR: Wore yellow dress that looked white under black lights. Was asked to leave by a member of the wedding party. Didn’t leave. Told I made others uncomfortable by a friend the next day.

TheGoodM1lk,AITA for telling my mom's boyfriend he had a say in his PTSD ,2024-11-13T21:53:07.541000+0000,54,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqoohb/aita_for_telling_my_moms_boyfriend_he_had_a_say/,"I'm a disabled 21 year old woman and my mom's current boyfriend (m 46) doesn't believe i am. I struggle with a lot of mental health issues(child hood PTSD, major depression, anxity, ADHD and autim. all dignoised by a profesinal and i am in treatment for them all) from childhood trauma and have severe chronic migraines. But overall I seem like a “normal” person, and I think that's what he gets stuck on.
Every time I try to talk about problems to my mom, well he's around. It turns into a dick measuring competition of which one of us is more disabled. Personally I think that's a regressive mindset and puts more stigma on mental health by saying there's a magical bar you have to get to for your struggles to really matter. But clearly he thinks two different disabilities should be measured on a one to one scale and his disability is worse than mine. He states that he's disabled to but doesn't have nearly as much trouble as I do and his disability is worse than mine. His disability being ptsd from time as a marin.
He believes because he's really disabled (the government sends him money every month) And I'm not( because it's incredibly difficult to get disability for migraines) that he gets to tell me how to handle my disability and that i'm doing it poorly. Not only that he very much implies that I'm not just playing up my issues but faking them.
This all came to a head when I told him well he was on another of his tirades, That he got a say in his disability. Not only Is he a man and his issues are actually taken seriously by the medical industry, but he applied for the military knowing about ptsd. He got 18 years of normality before going into the military, and he knew he had a risk of developing ptsd when he went in. I however was born this way and had no control over my trauma as I was a child when it occurred.
Please don't get me wrong. I fully respect veterans and their need for treatment. They deserve respect and validation. I was just tired of him telling me I wasn't disabled and had no excuse for not being a fully functional member of society because even if I was disabled he can function just fine.
I have never before played down his ptsd (and I don't think pointing out he had an idea that going into the military could and likely would result in ptsd is me down playing it.) I normally don't even justify his comments about me with a real response. I just wanted to point out that it's not fair to compare our struggles on a one to one scale, and that i am just as deserving of understanding for my disabilities as he is. After 2 years of him degrading and belittling my issues.
Now he's trying to get my mom to kick me out because of how disrespectful I was to him. Even though this is the first time I have ever snapped back at him, well he's always going on and on and on about how I'm a failure of a human being.

The one thing keeping me going was the thought of having a wild night when he got home. My boyfriend’s sister texted me and asked if she could come over when he got home.
I said we would both be really tired and eager to be alone, and said it’d be best to wait. Then I put my phone on silent, which meant I didn’t see her next text that said she “knew her brother, he’ll find energy to say hi”
When he got home, the moment he was sufficiently unpacked, I changed into a playboy bunny suit. Then his sister knocked on the door and yelled hello. I was pretty pissed off, so I didn’t put in any effort to hide my angry expression and answered the door in the outfit. I was pretty cold with her, and she got passive aggressive before reluctantly leaving.
She said it was petty and dramatic over the phone, and I just hung up, prompting some angry texts. AITA?",,t3_1gprfsw,AITA

They are doing great in school, excellent grades despite both being on athletic teams and extra curriculars that are a time suck. I'm very proud Dad for how they are doing.
As a reward for doing so well I have told them I'd pay their way for a vacation during their spring break in a few months, anywhere that they'd like to go (well, within reason. If either picked Antarctica we'd have to talk about that).
The boys wanted to go to an all-inclusive resort in Jamaica, apparently a whole bunch of their friends from school have the same idea and want a big fun group trip.
I was all for that, and all for Jamaica. That sounds like fun (I've been to Jamaica years ago and had a great time). However a combination of overhearing some details and seeing some info has me a bit unsettled.
They have plans to go to a resort called -- get this -- Hedonism. I looked it up (maybe that was my mistake). Hedonism is apparently pretty raunchy, very ""adult,"" and is pretty much the Caribbean's answer to Hefner's Playboy Mansion. It's got just about everything you'd want in a resort as far as activities and such, but just about the whole place is ""clothing optional"" and some of the places like one of the beaches and a couple of the pools are actually REQUIRED nude. And they have things like ""playrooms"" and ""happening huts"" and one can only imagine what goes on there. There's theme nights like ""naughty nurses"" and ""fetish leather and lingerie.""
I gave that the hard ""nope."" I want to reward them, but I'm not about to fund what sound like nothing short of an orgy. They were NOT impressed with my decision, not in the least.
So am I an asshole for backing out of funding the vacation I promised?
P.S. I am not a prude. Far from it. I know they have sex. They are gorgeous popular athletic boys on a college campus, I'm not that dumb. They're probably having a lot of it. I'm fine with that, encouraging even. I bought them both condoms starting when they were 16. I want them to have fun, I want them to get busy as long as they are smart and safe and respectful, and make great college memories. I just don't want to pay for a nude-a-rama at the Caribbean fuck-a-torium on my dime.

Sometimes I find it a bit irritating with her constantly asking questions about it when I'm trying to focus on my learning, but I've just learnt to be patient with it.
So me and my friend are in math class, doing some new algebra stuff. And while I'm doing the practice worksheet, she asks me to explain it to her, but I'm trying to focus on practicing the concept for myself, so I tell her that I'll explain in to her in a second, and that I just need to finish doing the worksheet first. I'm pretty sure my tone wasn't rude or anything, but when I turned back to her 10 minutes later and offer to help her, she said that if I couldn't be bothered to help her, I should just stop bothering her. She didn't speak to me for the rest of the lesson.
Later in the day I apologised and said that If I came across at all rude I did not mean to, but she is still angry at me.

When he mops the floor, he would have a bucket to fill it up with water and cleaning solution and once he's done, he will rinse out the water and reuse the bucket the next day.
But the issue is that he has been using the same bucket for 5+ years and occasionally, he would just clean the bucket and continue to use it. I have asked him many many times to change the bucket for once cuz it's been used for that long and he would insist that since it's not broken, it can still be used. But this time I had enough and I got in a stupid and a heated argument asking him to change the bucket since it would have so much disgusting dirty stains, soapy, sticky and grout?? (Idk the word) and I told him that there is no point in cleaning and reusing so many times and it's easier and more hygienic to replace a $5 bucket. He would counter and compare to things like ""why don't you throw away your clothes, your furniture, since you have been using it for many years too""
He said I should stop insisting on changing the bucket but the thing is It's actually disgusting since it's used to mop the floors and although the bucket isn't broken, it's so used that it's better to replace a 5+ year bucket for once😭.

My dad 51m and I 20f have had a strained relationship for a long time. We try to be civil, but he has some anger management issues, and always has since I was a kid. My siblings have a different mom and he was afraid of losing them so growing up I was the one who ended up being the emotional punching bag (he himself has admitted to this). Things has gotten better and we’ve both put in work and I’ve sought counseling and therapy as well.
Recently however he has seemingly regressed to how it was when I was younger. I attribute it to stress, but can’t find it in myself to excuse it. He recently had a minor surgery (not even out under or had any strong meds prescribed) and returned to work with little pain or complication. And yet I can’t seem to have a simple conversation with him without it becoming an issue, and my mom always takes his side on things which is incredibly frustrating because they, especially my mom, always end up apologizing retroactively.
This is about the latest incident in particular. Our dog was being reactive toward our other dog and we separated them, the reactive one is on the younger side and has received training, but has been getting more aggressive lately. So once things calmed down and we made sure our other dog wasn’t hurt I made a comment saying that “we need to get him into training” and immediately my dad snapped at me and started yelling at me. Saying there “was no we”, saying overall hurtful things to me, and then accusing me of not taking care of the dogs. Note that they have had me stay home on trips and vacations to care for these dogs and go out multiple nights a week leaving me with them, and during the day I’m usually in class or doing school work, but I let them out, feed them, and help out when I can.
We had an argument and things got a bit heated. I didn’t quite match his tone, but I will admit that I raised my voice. I was saying that my comment was an offhand one and my word choice was not intentional in the first place, because I knew it was not worth it to even argue that I do help out with the dogs. We argued for a while more and I called him an A-hole for yelling at me out of no where and starting an argument where there wasn’t one purely over semantics. I admit it may have been out of line, but I also refuse to apologize because this is not the first time this week something like this has happened and I don’t think deserve to have someone else’s issues taken out on me. My mom said it was uncalled for, but I am unsure and thought I would ask about it here.

I (24 female) currently work at a Hooters in Texas. It was a busy day dealing with GROOOSSSSS men so I was already in a bit of a mood but one customer stood out to me. It was mid shift when I group of older guys came in and were sat down in my section. There was one guy in particular who was eyeing me up and down right when I asked them if they wanted to start with drinks. He looked to be about 45-50 years old and was balding (we’ll call him Jeff)… immediate red flag. They all ordered margaritas and Jeff asked me if I was gonna ask for ID, I laughed and started to close up my book and walked away as I turned around he whistled at me and was holding his ID. I politely took it and gave a two second glance before handing it back. The other guys at the table seemed to be just as uncomfortable as I was. The whistling really got me going but I remained calm cause I got bills to pay and tips with these types are usually good. When I came back from with the drinks Jeff commented on my hair saying it “lays nicely on my chest” whatever that means and I didn’t know what to say. It was clear the other guys were super uncomfortable as was I. I said a polite thank you and got started on their food. Fast forward after the orders and food had made its way to the table I did my usual check in. I could hear them laughing from across the restaurant and they seemed to go quiet as I approached, I was able to make out Jeff saying watch this. When I got up to ask if everything was tasting alright Jeff looked at the guys at the table and said “it’s tasting great but can we talk about those lips are they natural if so you’ve got a perfect set of lips.” Everyone at the table and in the general vicinity went quiet because WTF like that had to be a double meaning but I was too grossed out to think of it. About 20 minutes go by without checking on them and one of Jeff’s friends signaled me for the check so I brought it over and asked the usual together or separate. Jeff insisted on paying so I handed the bill to him waited for him to finish up and thanked them for coming in. As they were leaving I saw Jeff’s friend start to put a $20 bill on the table and Jeff told him to put it away. When I looked at the check to make sure it went through I saw a big fat 0 by the tip. This is where I got a little petty but mind you I kept a very good composure the whole time I served them so I asked if there was a problem with the service. Jeff smiled and said maybe next time pull your shirt down a little or wear a smaller size. I lost it. I told him that the job was bad enough having to flaunt around like some show pony but guys like him make it even worse. I even told him that the world would be better without bald headed fucks like himself. Then I walked away. I’m not proud of it but he was just so gross.

For a bit of context: I (18 non-binary) have autism, and was diagnosed at age 15 but have known for as long as I can remember l've been autistic. My older brother was diagnosed when he was younger and my mom put me in testing ever since l was past the age of just copying my older brother and developing my own personality. And as I grew up I started doing my own research because I grew up around people who had the mentality that I wasn't diagnosed with ASD i couldn't be autistic. So I wanted to be sure that I actually was autistic and it wasn't my mom pushing something on me which she's done before. Over the years I was so sure I was autistic, and had collected multiple three ring binders with charts and articles that I felt proved that I was autistic and not just anxious like all the doctors said I was. Onto the story, ever since I've gotten my diagnosis my mom has been acting different than before. Shes stopped talking to me like an adult, and not in like a 'oh you're my baby!' kind of way I mean like in the way people baby talk their dog or cat. Like I know I'm young being 18 but I'm an adult. And I've been able to have more 'adult' conversations with my family since I was 10, and she's had conversations like that with me before. But after my diagnosis it's like she's treating me like I'm a toddler or something. Like I'll be writing a paper about a topic I'm passionate about or think are interesting to pass the time and she'll lean over my shoulder (which she knows I hate anyways) and say ""Wow! Those are some complicated topics you're writing about!"" Like I know, l've written about this before. Or I'll be doing research on things like how Autism Speaks is inherently ableist and harmful to the community, which leads to looking at charts and graphs about their spending and lack there of it towards Autistic families/ people and she'll loudly say ""Wow! I don't know how you can understand that!"" Like it's not hard to understand, it's color coded and has a paragraph explaining it in more detail. And before anyone asks, she doesn't do this with my brother. It's just me, and nobody else in the family on either side does this.

She hates driving so I said I would be able to take her. We are both 20, so this was the first time either one of us have had to do this. She said she had to go early in the morning. This work out for me since I had work at 4pm. I was under the impression that she had a case and it would only be a few hours. A few days before jury duty she brought it up in a conversation with my mom. My mom told her that typically it’s a all day ordeal. I told her I would figure something out. Fast forward to the night before. She tells me that she has to be at the courthouse by 8am. I tell her that’s fine and I ask her when she will be done, and she said that they didn’t tell her. So I looked on line and it was saying 4pm, when I have to go to work. I told her I’ll tell my boss I’ll be 20 mins late.He would have been cool with it, but she doesn’t what me to do that. I told her I’ll dive her car to the courthouse and ride my bike back. It’s only a 30ish min bike ride and I love to ride my bike, but she says no to it. I even tell her I can drop her off and see if my mom can pick her up, she still said no. She then got pissy at me saying that’s she disappointed and that I promised her I would take her. She was the one who waited to the night before to call, and I was just working with what I had. I understand that I promised her. I wish timing would have worked out better and maybe I should have figured out how long it was going to take before I promised her. But hindsight is 2020 and we were both under the impression that it was only going to take a few hours in the morning. She said she was sorry for the way she talked to be that night, but she said that she can’t help but feel disappointed and has been distant for the rest of the day. AITA?
Note: I don’t know if this changes your opinions much, but there’s is a detail I have to clarify. She never asked me to take her. I offered my self. She can and will drive herself. The courthouse is about a 15-20 min drive and basically all new roads we never have a reason to head over in that direction. She dose get road anxiety and in her own words “I need time to prepare my self before driving to a new place” or something very close to that. She was frustrated at the fact that up until the last min she was going to get a ride. When she realized that I could make it happen without inconveniencing someone she just accepted that she was going to have to take herself.
She has admitted that the situation wasn’t my fault, she said that she just can’t help but feel disappointed. I think more so because I didn’t try to figure it out before the night before, but I still offered different solutions. And I’m all fairness we both new that it could have been a problem and neither one of us did anything proactively.",,t3_1gqxb5p,AITA
zesty_like_a_lemon,WIBTAH if I continue to swear with my friends?,2024-11-15T00:59:52.571000+0000,0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grkcvl/wibtah_if_i_continue_to_swear_with_my_friends/,"All of the following names are fake including the one I use for myself. Ok so I (14f) do competitive gymnastics. I have a friend on my team called Amanda. Now me and her are pretty close but I’m not as close as her as I am to Nora, Lexi, and Katie. I have known Lexi for a long time more than every one else. So yesterday I came to practice as normal and Lexi and Nora started talking. Soon they called me over and Nora took out her phone and said,
“Zayden, Amanda added us to a group chat and said that we need to talk about your swearing problem.” I was very confused to say the least because why would she make a whole group chat about me with my other friends, talk about me, and try to have an intervention about me swearing. She said things like “My parents don’t want me going to anything she invited to because I’m a ‘bad influence’ and “it’s a sin in the Bible and my family is super religious like my dad doesn’t even like LGBTQ people.
I am lesbian and finding out her dad is anti lgbtq makes me uncomfortable. 2. Can someone please tell me if swearing is actually a sin because I have never stepped foot into a church before. I get people have boundaries and her parents don’t want her swearing but all my friends and parents agree I am in the right.
So here is where I may be in the wrong, I have decided that I will continue swearing just not in front of her parents. I never swear in front of adults on purpose. I plan on talking to her tomorrow and I’m glad I have friends that stand up for me when I’m not there they are my true friends I hope they know that.
Anyway, advice is always welcome because I’m in a bit of a predicament I will update you on how it goes. Make sure to eat, sleep, drink, and take care of yourself love yall bye 💕.",,t3_1grkcvl,AITA

My friend (26M) and I (27M) went tubing down the river during a group hang (we were the only two guys in the group). During one rough patch, he got thrown off his tube, and when he came up, he realized he’d lost his swimsuit in the current. We were both pretty shocked and started trying to figure out what to do since we were far from our towels and extra clothes. He asked if I’d let him borrow my shorts since I was wearing athletic boxers underneath, which look kind of like swim trunks anyway. He figured I’d be less embarrassed since I still had more coverage than he does (he was wearing much shorter tighter underwear).
I really didn’t want to walk around in just my boxers, even if they looked like shorts. My friend insisted I add this was the southern us so NO ONE was wearing speedos. Plus, I didn’t want to be the one dealing with stares. Instead, I offered to help him stay mostly in the water until we could get back to our stuff, but he was really annoyed I wouldn’t just help him out. He ended up trying to stay submerged, but it was definitely an awkward walk back, and he’s been joking that I “let him down” when he needed help. AITA?",,t3_1gqpq8i,AITA

In the past everything I wanted to do, had or showed interest in was shut down by my parents. They took away what I had, broke me down and that is the light part of the abuse. The only thing they never managed to get away was my drawing and writing. Only a pen, paper and my mind was needed.
Recently I started drawing again more and this is an entire process since I can't draw on the computer. It means I spend hours drawing, then cutting out and scanning in layer per layer. An editor then helps me smooth the colours. I usually have a drawing with a theme and a story behind. I have made friends through an online game and I spend time drawing pfp for it. A few of the friends had send my art to the developers of the game for new hero introductions. This got attention and I was asked to make something. I had just finished a drawing I had worked on for 7 days and I loved it. So I send that one in through a friend.
Yesterday that friend told me, which I first assumed was a joke, he named the drawing after himself and that it was based on something 100% unrelated. When he asked in the groupchat if I was mad I said yes. After that it went quiet. Nobody else spoke up so I started thinking I overreacted. And shouldn't be mad. But the emotions, the trauma, it all started spreading and I felt like my art was taken away. That what my parents failed, he succeeded. I started crying while trying to draw, had a panic attack and destroyed my latest drawing in the process.
So I decided I best left the group for a while to calm down and reset my emotions. I had told our main leader. Of course people reached out, i just told I would be back after calming down a bit and placing these emotions before I did something dumb and started an argument or lashed out to someone telling me to just ignore it.
The friend who named the drawing and made a fake story on it has not reacted to all. Which also only makes me more annoyed at it all. It is making me also think I overreact. And that I am the AH for making a drama of it.
AITA for reacting angrily and also withdrew because he named my drawing after himself and spun a fake story on it?
Edit1: The art has my watermark on it and my name. The developer knows he dindn't make it.",,t3_1gqz004,AITA

We have two kids (4m and 7f). About 5 years ago our house was finally built, Ella was the one who actually designed our house. We have a loft area above our living room that Ella said was going to be a kids area. “Out of sight out of mind” she said for the kids toys. Ella also suffers from depression and I lot of the house projects she hoped would be done by now aren’t. Personally I think she’s too hard on herself and I do help as much as I can but I also work 60-70 hours a week. Ella has been using the loft area as a reading area, honestly I’m not too sure how much she uses it. I know she read a bit, but mostly when I see her read it’s in bed. Ella has been hard on herself lately, because the kids toys are scattered everywhere so I decided while she was out to have the kids take everything up into the loft area and put all her stuff into her gaming room (we both have our own separate gaming rooms.) The kids LOVE this area and in the time they’ve been playing up there I have seen no toys. Ella came home and started crying saying that was her safe heaven area away from everyone and has been really short with me .She claims that she goes up there everyday and now she can’t just take it away from the kids. I told her she can make her gaming room into a reading room but she states the kids go in there and it’s not the same. I told her she was overreacting and this is exactly what she wanted this area for so AITA
TLDR wife designed house for the kids to have an area in loft, then got made when I made the area a loft area.
Edit: I can’t believe I have to say this but, obviously my wife is not neglecting our children by giving herself time to do her activities. As for our 4 year old, our neighbor watches him about 2-5 hours a day we pay them) so my wife can bake for her business and just to whatever she wants.
Final edit: I hear you all, I should’ve 100% communicated with her. I also found out she hasn’t used her gaming room in months so I took away her favorite spot of the house. So we will be moving the kids stuff into her old gaming room and I will be making a shelf so she can organize all her books up there.",,t3_1gptix7,AITA

When I was about 8ish my mom found out that my dad had cheated on her, they got into an extremely nasty divorce. My dad got 15 percent visitation (so every other weekend) and 50 percent legal custody. Over those beginning years my mom made me hate my dad, which is understandable dude to him cheating on her, but whatever, so she made me hate him by making me hate going over to his house and all of that fun stuff. After many years I was finally an adult and could do my own things, but she wanted me to keep living with her, well I moved from Pennsylvania to Alabama and well, that’s where stuff is hitting the fan, now onto the story.
So about mid October I went out and visited my dad, while I was there he asked me to go and live with him for a few months to then go off to the military, he told me to tell my mom and my grandma before I do. I told them and well after I told them, my mother freaked out and went hey wire, she threatened to put her self in a mental hospital, that she wouldn’t get out if she did, she told me after my 15 year old husky passes that I no longer have a home with her, my mother also told me she no longer will cultivate a relationship with me. She is basically disowning me because of this. I told my dad and now he’s moved up my moving date from the 6th of December to the 22nd of November so just over a week away.

BeginningGeologist99,AITA for asking my sister not to invite her partner to our plans?,2024-11-13T22:06:06.499000+0000,30,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqozo4/aita_for_asking_my_sister_not_to_invite_her/,"My (32F) sister (33F) just got married recently and has been with her partner a little over a year. I have no negative feelings about him, I think he's very nice and never mind seeing him. However, since they got together, there have been a couple of occasions where she has invited him to join plans we have made without asking. I get that she just wants him involved because she loves him, so I usually don't say anything.
Earlier this year we made plans to hang out at my house and she asked if he could come. I hadn't seen her in a while and just wanted to spend time with my sister, and I asked if it could just be us and if he could join next time. She didn't seem bothered by it and said no problem and just came alone. However, the following time I did make sure he was invited and we had dinner together.
Last week my sister reached out to me and asked if we could go out for my birthday, and I said I would love to have a sister date, but as I was out of town we would have to find another weekend. For reference I am 26 weeks pregnant, have a 2 year old, and just got back from vacation on Monday. She asked if I would be free the following weekend (this weekend) and I said yes *but* that my husband was getting oral surgery this Thursday and would need me to be primary care for our daughter over the weekend, so that she was welcome to come over and hang out but that I may be dealing with a lot. I said we might be able to take my daughter and go out for lunch/dinner depending on how the day goes and if my husband needs time alone to rest; otherwise we'd just hang out at the house.
She replied that she already invited her partner and they'd love to take me out. This bothered me a little bit because not only was it never brought up that he would be coming (I specifically called it a ""sister date""), but with everything I am dealing with over the weekend I felt like it was a bit rude to invite an additional guest over to my house without asking. I do not think she meant anything by it, my sister is a very sweet person who isn't purposefully rude or disrespectful. However, I am working on setting boundaries with those around me so I texted her the following: ""I don't mind if [partner] comes, obviously I like [partner]. But in the future can we discuss that kind of thing beforehand? It's just I'm dealing with a lot and [my husband] has to have surgery and I don't necessarily want additional guests. I don't expect you to uninvite him this time, I was just kind of expecting it to be a sister date since you said you wanted to take me out for my birthday"".
ATIA? I don't want my sister or her partner to feel unwelcome and it was very uncomfortable for me to say this in the first place instead of biting my tongue as to not stir up any unnecessary hurt feelings. How can I balance spending time with my sister and also making sure her partner doesn't feel unwelcome?",,t3_1gqozo4,AITA

English is not my language so excuse any grammatical errors! I’m also dyslexic so that don’t help lmao)
I (17m) am an autistic introvert. that means I love and I mean love my alone time. When I’m alone I tend to act out scenes with music from my favorite shows and movies, talk to myself out loud, etc etc.
Today was supposed to be one of those days where I get that alone me time for 2 and a half hours. My mum and sister go to jujitsu at this time. However, today, my sister said she didn’t want to go so after forty minutes they came home without warning. Without texting or calling me first so I had my headphones at full volume, dancing. They rang the doorbell and it took me a few minutes to answer because I didn’t hear them. My mum scolded me for that. When I asked them why they were home, mum said “because we didn’t want to go.”
Now I’ll admit, I had several issues with this whole situation.
My sister had skipped that session for weeks now just cause “she didn’t want to go.”
They didn’t warn me before hand, ruining my alone time that I cherish to much.
My mum got mad at me for having my headphones in.
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS ALONE MUM. What does she think a teenager my age does if not have their headphones at max volume, let’s be honest here. 😭
So, my reaction to all of this information happening all at once was to, well, start crying and, without saying anything because i didn’t want to start yelling, get my coat and leave.
After like an hour, I came home and my mum started yelling about how I’m overreacting and I’m “so sensitive” and “it’s not that big of a deal”
My mum is actually a really cool and chill mum most of the time, so her yelling scares the fuck out of me so I didn’t say anything back.
Now I’m sitting in my room, genuinely wondering that maybe she’s right and I shouldn’t have reacted like that.

The work contributes to his family letting us live here and not pay for rent or utilities, though I have offered to pay for rent before and his mom turned my offer down. I just moved to his area, so I'm still looking for a job.
I thrive in a house that's clean and clutter-free, but my boyfriend on the other hand does not care and will leave a mess around the house and it won't get cleaned unless I ask him (sometimes asking doesn't even work) or do it myself which upsets me because then I feel like his mother.
When we eat, he'll often forget his dish and just walk away. I have reminded and asked him multiple times to grab his dish when he gets up, if I ask him in the moment that he's walking away he'll grab it. But if I don't ask him and I don't get it for him, he won't get it until the next time we sit there. We recently talked about this, he said that the dishes are ""ours"" and wonders why I don't get it if it bothers me. I've tried to explain that when I do that, I feel like his mother. He says that he usually forgets to grab his dish and that he ""can't change who (he) is"" and that it's just a fault he has. But, he has told me that I should ""change myself"" and not let it bother me so much.
He will strip from his dirty clothes in the TV room and leave them on the floor for awhile. He often leaves them in the walking path too, so it's not out of the way. Him leaving it there bothers me a lot, which he knows, and he thinks I'm being petty for not picking it up since it bothers me so much.
He acquired a large tortoise that lives in our backyard, which has concrete. It mostly shits near the door, which he doesn't clean up often. He also takes awhile to clean up her pee spots which she also does a lot on the concrete. I asked him if he could clean it up, since I/we also like to sit outside there and the sight of the poop and pee spots are gross to me, and it also stinks. He told me that I should clean it if it bothers me. I told him that it's his pet and that he should be the one to clean up after her, and he told me that it's ""our"" tortoise. But, I wasn't asked if I wanted a tortoise or if I wanted to help in the cleaning of it which I don't. Is it wrong for me to want him to clean up after it and not do it myself?
My boyfriend thinks that if something that he's doing/not doing bothers me, I should fix it myself (IE, clean up his mess). AITA for believing that he should change his ways and pick up after himself because it bothers me when he doesn't? Should I just clean up after him to keep my sanity?",,t3_1gqwyf8,AITA

My father always suggests that we should offer him a ride, but I never really want to. Even though we’re in the same class we’ve never really talked, and I just don’t know how to act around him. Plus, I’m a girl and he’s a guy, which I guess for me adds to the awkwardness.
One day though, I was running late and as usual, we saw my classmate at the bus stop. This time, before I could say anything, my dad slowed down and steered the car toward him. In that moment, I panicked. Without thinking, I screamed to not let him in the car. My father actually stopped the car but he also just stared at me blankly clearly kinda pissed. We ended up not giving the guy a ride but we did end up in a heated argument. My dad was frustrated and pointed out that by not offering him a ride, I might have made him late to class (which he actually was late for about three minutes lmao). He didn’t understand why I made such a big deal out of it. I tried to explain, but he's still convinced I’m in the wrong.
Now, every time we pass that bus stop, there’s this awkward tension between us and I’m not sure how to bring it up again without feeling like I’m overreacting.",,t3_1grv4ct,AITA

I’m 18m and get paid more then my mother. My mother 40m used to get into fights and arguments and when i moved out it was when she was gone. My mother did not like it at all and tried to threaten me with saying my girlfriend’s parents were kidnapping and she was gonna call the cops. Fast forward to a few days ago me and my girlfriend are out getting stuff for me hygiene and clothes and shoes wise at the mall i get a phone call from my mom and she’s demanding i pay her 25 dollars but doesn’t say what (she has a bad addiction to drugs). When i tell her no im not giving her the money she goes ballistic on me saying its my right to give her that money that im her son and i should help her and alot of other stuff. I just i love you mom hang up. After the mall and alot of threatening voice mails and texts i block her we go to a good moral chicken place. My mother works here but it was supposed to be her day off not thinking we order our food and my mother is right there she then flips us off and right “fuck you love mom” on all of our bags. Then when we leave she texts me from a different number saying “you have enough to buy chicken but not to give me thats a lousy son for you” after that my gf takes my phone and texts her she then calls my gf a stupid fucking cunt and a dumb Lazy whore. My gf sets it off on my mother and blocks her and then we call her boss and tell him what’s going on. The boss then says that she has been pulled off the line and having a talking to. My mother then texts me saying i almost costed her job that my girlfriend is a stupid slut that doesn’t but to drop dead and that im a stupid ass hole that doesn’t deserve love.

I got a text from my mother on a different number last night and told me to unblock her or there will consequences when i told her that no i was not she proceeded to call me and spam my phone with her friends calling a petty pos. Im not getting back lash on facebook and even calls from people i don’t know harassing me. Shes resorted to my closest friend’s calling me and telling there no longer my friends bc of what happened and now I’m no longer allowed at the thanksgiving family dinner (I’m more then likely still going to go) the reason why I’m still going is because my girlfriend has not met that side of the family I’m sure my mother will not do something at the dinner hopefully.

My (30M) girlfriend (28F) is very extroverted and really enjoys big activities, socializing, and other things that generally require a lot of energy. I, on the other hand, am more of an introvert and typically prefer to read or play games. I like socializing and doing activities every now and again, especially if we're in a situation that calls for it (i.e. karaoke at a birthday party, going out for drinks, etc.) but generally I like to keep to myself. It's relaxing to stay indoors and do calming activities.
Recently my girlfriend asked me if I would have an at-home karaoke session with her. We've done this before at different social events, and I don't mind it when the time is right, but I really didn't have any interest in singing into a microphone in my own home. Let me say that typically I usually give my girlfriend what she wants and often do activities with her that I don't really feel like doing in the moment, but usually we end up having fun all the same.
She says that other couples do it all the time, and that she wants to make it a regular thing for us, but to be honest it's a little embarrassing to do karaoke at home. We have a great relationship and I know we're soulmates; I'm happy to do other activities with her at home too, it's just karaoke specifically that I really don't think I would be into doing.
Then again, I may be an asshole because I know in reality it really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. AITA for not wanting to do karaoke?",,t3_1gquss9,AITA

She never finished her own education, so due to me being the eldest and also her only ""daughter"" she puts a lot of expectations on my back and tends to project onto me quite a bit because she ended up at a job she hates and wants me to do The Best. I'm not exactly the perfect student she wants, I do well but not exactly the top level she wants, and this makes her annoyed to no end.
She's pretty much always been this way, or at least since I turned 14 and entered yr10 at school. I didn't do too well grade wise (not failing, just average all around) that year since I was in a pretty bad mental crashout due to various issues, and she got really annoyed and yelled at me so much she sent me into an anxiety attack. She also thought it was ""funny"" that I was scared of her for ages afterwards and openly told me she was proud of that.
The current issue: I've skipped maybe one and a half days of college since September, with the full day being because I slept terribly the previous night and felt like hell, and the half day (today, and also the main issue) because I had really bad period cramps and nothing was helping so I went home.
Well, mother lost her damn mind, screaming, crying, the whole bag - simply because I missed an afternoon because it felt like my lower abdomen was tearing itself apart and I couldn't deal with the pain. I believe some of her comments included things like ""You're going to be kicked off the course"" and ""You're going to end up pregnant and on drugs in an alleyway"" (yeah, she said that lol) and calling me a heartless bitch.
Needless to say, I didn't want to talk to her afterwards, mostly because I was still annoyed about what she said to me and I was feeling petty because she didn't even apologise for it, and she got angry at me again for ""being an asshole.""
AITA for not speaking to her? I know what I did was petty and I'm honestly just conflicted here. I know she wants the best for me and hell, I want the best for me too, but her words hurt really badly.",,t3_1gqieu7,AITA

I’ve never posted here but to be fair I really need some insight. Me (22M) and my friend (21F) have been working on a comic for almost 5 years. It is a project I truly love, I think about it every day and I really want to see it through. However, I do not know if my friend feels the same way. She says she does, but her actions don’t make it seem that way. I have struggled with this feeling for a while now, almost a year. And finally today I exploded because i feel she doesn’t care as much for it as I do and it’s frustrating. So for context, I am the writer and she’s the illustrator. We worked on the story and everything to have all in place, so now after a few years I finally wrote a bit; two chapters. We always teased each other about finally doing “our jobs”, so I thought that finally giving her something tangible would make her more prone to work on her part, like doing some sketches of the characters or trying things out with their designs. However, it’s been a month since I told her to check the chapters out and she still hasn’t done it. She is a busy girl I might clarify. She is close to becoming a nurse, so she is doing her internships and everything. However, I am also busy, mostly with things around the house and my senior project, though I will start work next month. The main difference I feel is that despite not having much free time when I do I try to use it all in the development of this comic, but when she is free she prefers to do other stuff; she procrastinates a lot. And ngl I do so too, I am diagnosed with ADHD and I suspect she might be AuDHD, but that’s besides the point. The thing is I understand she might sometimes not feel like it, that she might be too tired and overwhelmed, but then again she never “feels like it” when it comes to working on the comic. But I also feel like that, most of the time too, but I usually turn to this because I find comfort, joy and fun in working on this story. And I feel she does not and that difference is what makes me upset. Because despite her saying she does love this project, that difference is what strikes me. So finally today after she told me she was doing an animatic of another thing she’s into I blew off. She always has time and will for every other thing but like I said it’s been a month and she still hasn’t checked the chapters. But she has time to do a whole animatic? And don’t get me started on how many illustrations (full and colored) she has done compared to the ones of our characters; she has barely finished one in all our years working together, while she does like 2 or 3 of her other stuff a month. I told her i wanted to take time from working on the comic. I feel frustrated and upset, not seeing the same level of commitment and interest that I have. I don’t wanna ruin the friendship but I’ve been holding this inside for a long time. I might focus in my own projects, cuz I have them.
So is it right for me to get mad and tell her that I want to take a break? After of course explaining to her how I feel. Or AITA?",,t3_1gqxgta,AITA

He did a fine job, but the cut was a little uneven; and while I was satisfied with it, I told myself in the future that I was probably just going to wait until I was home on holiday breaks for haircuts.
Every time I mention needing a haircut or that I'm going to get one once I'm home, my friend says he'd be willing to cut my hair again, but he isn't insistent or anything and doesn't push it when I tell him I'm just going to wait until I'm home.

She recently started driving lessons and will have driven the supervised required amount of time to get her license in two or three weeks. I am older than this friend and have had my permit for longer than she has. Despite me having my permit for longer, I only have 1/3 of the supervised drive time needed to attempt getting my license. This is because I am not enrolled in any sort of driving lessons or driving school and my parents don't take me driving very much. My dad offers to take me each weekend, but never follows through and actually takes me. My mom is very impatient and often yells at me while I drive. She also doesn't let me drive anywhere further then 10 minutes from our house. This makes it so im only ever logging very small amounts of driving, (usually 2 ten to five minute drives logged a week at most).
I know this is kind of stupid but I'm jealous of my friend. I'm older than her but she'll already have her license in no time AND she got a car for her birthday so she'll be able to drive wherever whenever pretty much. I feel like I'm behind because I dont have a car and I don't have a license, and I'm not close to getting either and that's the part that makes me most jealous I think. I feel really bad but I just cant shake the jealous feeling.
The only other adult in my family that I would be able to/comfortable with learning to drive from is my grandma. I know that if I asked her to take me she would say yes in a heart beat but she's gotten hit (by other drivers in the wrong, not her fault) two times in the last 3-4ish years and I think it would stress her out. I decided to talk to my mom if she could either start taking me driving consistently and for longer (like for 1-2 hours each Sunday or Monday or both cuz those are her days off) or if she could sign me up for driving school. (I feel bad cuz it's expensive but I still felt like bringing it up as an option. Id be willing to pay for part of it.) Well before I could even mention the driving school option, my mom cut me off. She got upset with me and told me she couldn't take me because it was super late at night (it was 7:30) and she just got home from work and she was too tired to take me driving. I tried telling her I wasn't asking to go at that very moment, and that I only wanted to know if we could make some sort of plan to get my driving time done with quicker.
Now my mom is super upset. She told my dad about it and they both think that im being selfish and inconsiderate for not understanding my mom cant take me driving whenever I feel like and for suggesting such an expensive option.

The overwhelming amount of advice, support, feedback and kind words meant more than you could ever know.
In case anybody is confused, here’s my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/P5YYpJ4Wim
So,
My wedding was just over a week ago, and it was absolutely perfect. It was me and J surrounded by the people we love and the ones who love us most.
Neither my Dad or E were there.
Following our last talk where I told him I didn’t care if he was present, it was complete silence from him for just over a month. I took my Dad’s silence as his mind made up, and I actually felt at ease with it, which was another huge wake-up call.
He finally messaged me in October and asked to talk over the phone. I told J and he said to do it and use the opportunity to make my final choice on the matter, and set it in stone.
So we spoke. He asked that I allow E at the wedding; I said no. He said that he wouldn’t come if she wasn’t there, I said I didn’t care. We went back and forth for a little bit, mostly just repeating ourselves, until he basically said “Is this really the hill you want to die on?”
I said yes, told him that he had a week to give me a simple yes or no as to whether he would be there, and hung up.
He messaged me a couple of days later with a looooong paragraph about how I was giving him ultimatums, making him choose, holding onto the past, petty and disrespectful, etc… And something snapped. I said that he had more than enough chances to attempt to make things right but that I was done, and blocked him.
On the day of my wedding, I tried not to think about it and it was honestly easier than I thought, to the point I didn’t realise he wasn’t there until midway through the ceremony.
I was hearing from mutual friends and family that my Dad has been pretty silent on the whole thing. Other members of my family/close friends were present at the wedding and asked why my Dad wasn’t there, and I just told them it was a story for another day (Not something I wanted to get into on my wedding).
Honestly, this entire situation is just draining. I’ve known for a long time that it would end in flames at some point or another, and I’m not entirely sure why I held out that little bit of hope for so long. I genuinely feel at peace for the first time in years, and relieved that I no longer have to deal with him or E.
I’m in bed with my now-husband writing this post, and feeling better than ever. I’ve realised I gave him too much of my time and patience when he didn’t deserve it. This toxic chapter of my life is done.
I’m more in love with my childhood sweetheart than I thought was possible and can’t stop grinning at the fact I get to call him my husband! Again, thank you so very much for of the responses! You’re all a lot wiser than I am! Have a great day, everyone. ❤️",,t3_1gpn1fm,AITA

We have 3 kids, 2 of them are his from his previous relationship 5M and 8M. The other kid is mine from a previous relationship and is 12M. He has shared custody and has the kids from Sunday morning to Tuesday until 5pm. The kids school and mom's residence is around 35 to 45 minutes from our place and he needs to take them to school on Monday and Tuesday and pick them up.
We have an agreement that he pays for the apartment and I pay for the car that is on my name including the insurance and expenses that come with owning a car. I found a job recently and they asked which days I wanted off and I requested Sunday and Monday. For me it made sense as I wanted to spend Sunday with all the kids and if we wanted to go out as a family there would be no issues with juggling work and family and Monday because is the busiest day with the kids with the homework and other stuff.
Here is where I might be in the wrong, when I told my fiance, he wanted for me to change my days off to Monday and Tuesday as he did not want to drive me to work that is 7 minutes driving from the house. We had a fight because I did not want to change my days off as I was already willing to walk home on Tuesdays so he could pick up the kids just to spend time with the boys. Now he is sleeping in in the kids room and not talking to me.

Phone came in, screen broken. I fixed it, told the customer to keep it away from water. It slipped my mind to tell them that the water protection was actually not there anymore the same way it is on a new phone.
Couple of days later, they text, saying that there's a problem with the front camera. I said okay, and told them I'll fix it, but they didn't bring it over immediately. (I put this part in later on an edit).
They dropped it in water (a bathtub), brought it back. I replaced the camera. Problem is, It's heating up because of water damage, nothing can be done about it. I've been trying my absolute best to get it done, but now that it's not possible, they either want a refund or a new phone altogether.
The thing is, water went in, and I'm not sure if it's because if it went that deep in water or because there was a crevice left open (which is near impossible considering I used multiple layers of glue & the old adhesive of the phone). The stuff I did is still working, and I tried to fix the damage I didn't even do, but I still feel bad. Did I really do something wrong here? Should I give them a refund, or get them a new phone out of pocket? Or am I just being guilt-tripped here?
Edit: One thing I forgot to mention here, is that they keep saying the business has been dishonest. They were under the assumption that we were somehow certified, which we never were, nor did we ever advertise or say that we were to anyone.
After this incident, every time someone brings a phone in, I make sure that they know that we're not certified by Apple or anyone else. Carrier stores continue to send us phones, yes, but we never claim that even they have in any way certified us.
Another thing that probably pissed them off is the fact that we asked them to pay for the water damage repairs, should they be possible. They thought we should take responsibility, since we ""broke"" the phone, but we fixed it, and what we fixed is still working right now.",,t3_1gqrikr,AITA
petulka_1984,AITA for wanting my boyfriend's kids to help me clean my car after they'd made a mess in it?,2024-11-13T09:47:50.310000+0000,109,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gq9d4v/aita_for_wanting_my_boyfriends_kids_to_help_me/,"I (40) like to keep my car clean. Over all I like everything clean - house, outdoor space, my desk. I live in my boyfriend's (37) house and even though we are reconstructing it I tidy everyday. I do admit I have a bit of OCD and if things aren't in their places I get nervous. Nothing crazy, but a clean space keeps me happy and content. Now to the issue. My boyfriend has two kids (11 and 15). We have them every second weekend. The girls are lovely and we get along. My only problem is that they are quite messy. They leave stuff everywhere, food in bed, bathroom full of hair, water all over the place. I say nothing and tidy it. My boyfriend has two cars and so do I. His cars are a mess, which I also clean from time to time because I enjoy doing it for him. He thinks it's unnecessary but doesn't mind. My cars are more new and fancy and he likes to use them. I do the driving when we use my cars. Whenever we take the girls somewhere they always leave it a mess. Mud on the carpets, hair and sweet wrappers all over. They get out, I vacuum, clean the carpets, wipe the seats and so on. I have been doing it for over two years and I have had enough. So last week I told my boyfriend that if the girls go in my car I want them to help me clean it - a 5-minute thing. I would be doing it with them. It was such an issue. He told me I was lame, that it's just a car and he sees no reason for them to help me. So I said fine and that we will use his car when he has the children and needs to drive them somewhere. I also pay for the petrol when we drive in my car. I feel it is unfair because I just want this one thing. So AITA?",,t3_1gq9d4v,AITA
Antique-Aardvark5807,WIBTA If I told my brother’s girlfriend that my mom is not her mom?,2024-11-12T21:23:38.997000+0000,1028,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gpvx1e/wibta_if_i_told_my_brothers_girlfriend_that_my/,"My brother (21M) has a girlfriend (21F) who is starting to get on a lot of my (24F) family’s nerves for different reasons. They’ve been together for almost 4 years.
The most prevalent issue to me is the ownership she seems to feel over my mom. My mom and I have always been really close, like insanely close. My brother’s girlfriend acts like she is jealous of that and is trying to have that same relationship with my mom.
For one thing, she calls my mom, “Mama.” She claims that she couldn’t say her name when her and my brother first got together. She also claims that she came up with the term “mama,” because I called my mom “mom.” I had long called my mom, “Mama” and that was even her name in my phone but now when I say the term I am accused of copying my brother’s girlfriend. However, I don’t think she should even be calling her that, because she’s not her mom. I shouldn’t be having to compete over what I’m allowed to call my own mom.
Secondly, she is acting like she knows my mom more than I do. I moved 2.5 hours away for a year. Now I visited at least every other weekend and sometimes stayed for days on end. I talked to my mom on the phone every single day for hours and hours and hours. Now, my brother’s girlfriend is claiming that I was gone for a year and that she has gotten to know my mom better than I do. My mom and I actually got into a very small argument one morning and I was like “why are you being mean?” My brother’s girlfriend jumped in and said, “She’s always like that, you’ll get used to it.” I was livid. How is she going to get involved in my argument with my own mom and pretend she knows what she’s like and I don’t?
She also invites herself to things my mom and I do alone. She puts herself into my mom and I’d traditions. Things my brother has never been apart of. She also comes over when my brother’s working and my mom and I are left to babysit her. She even physically gets between my mom and I at times. Also, she oversteps her boundaries at my mom’s house. She was eating groceries as my mom was putting them away instead of helping her clean up. She answers my mom’s phone out of her own pocket!
I feel like I’m getting to my boiling point and I think I either need to say something to her or my brother. I don’t want to have to compete with my brother’s girlfriend for my own mom.
Edited to add: Yes my mom is bothered by a lot of this. She doesn’t talk to my brother about it because he is very sensitive about his girlfriend and would likely blow up over it. My dad once asked him and his girlfriend to quiet down (they were wrestling on the floor screaming) and my brother left during a family event.",,t3_1gpvx1e,AITA
KarmaStarfish,AITA for refusing an impossible demand from my fair-weather bio dad?,2024-11-12T19:06:52.923000+0000,1561,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gpskzy/aita_for_refusing_an_impossible_demand_from_my/,"PSA for any confusion: my bio father “Jane” transitioned when I was 15 and lives as a lesbian woman.
I (41M) grew up entirely with my single mother. Jane (77F, but a cisman at the time) was a CEO entrepreneur who met my mom because she was scraping by as one of his assembly line workers. Jane abandoned me after I was born because “taking care of a baby is impractical while running a business,” and my mother “already has another kid, so it makes more sense.” As I grew, Jane dropped in 1-2 times a year to take me on short trips to places she wanted to see. Then she would send my mom angry letters afterward about how improper it was that I sipped the milk directly from my cereal bowl and didn’t own “three levels of clothing” for different events.
When I was 18, Jane got herself an absolutely wretched girlfriend who would later become her wife. “Lena” (67F)  is a trust fund baby who has never worked a real day in her life, and has three spoiled rotten children. For two decades, her relationship with Jane consisted of screaming fights, outrageous jealousy, possessiveness, vindictiveness, and hyper-controlling aggression marked by explosive public tantrums and verbal assaults on everyone else in Jane’s life. Many years ago in my early 30s, she publicly attacked me at Jane’s birthday dinner over a completely incorrect idea of why I parted ways with an ex-partner years earlier. She did this in front of my current partner, and demanded outrageous and intrusive details about my private life over it. I calmly told her it was none of her business, and I left. Amends were never made, because unsurprisingly, Lena never took responsibility for her outrageous behavior.
A few years later, Jane finally divorced Lena, but in the aftermath, we never really got much closer because frankly, I don’t really trust Jane and she has never been there for me. She still only reaches out to me when it’s convenient for her, and shows zero reflection on how a lifetime of parental neglect affected me and complicated every part of the way I grew up and found a place in the world.
Recently, Jane has decided not just to reconcile with Lena, but that they will soon remarry. She now wants me to accept and forgive all past “gripes and grievances” as she has, and become “one big happy family.” I have held my ground and refused to allow someone so unstable back into my life, and especially around my wife or children. To be honest, I am morally offended by Jane’s cluelessness, and in our last conversation, I lost my temper and told her off. How can someone who put in a <1% effort for 41 years now come around demanding the moon and stars from me? Her position is that if I don’t allow this toxic, volatile person back into my life, she will disinherit me. I told her to go fuck herself.
Last week, a relative reached out and asked me to go to therapy and reconcile. Her argument? The holidays are coming and it’s inconvenient that we are estranged. I’m at wits end here.",,t3_1gpskzy,AITA

The main project within the class is making a digital project based on any topic we want. Originally I was in a group with (fake names), Emma f(18), Erica f(19), Sam f (18), Will m (18) and Finn m(19). During our time with the project myself, Emma, Erica and Will would get into issues with Sam and Finn. They wouldn’t communicate properly about when they could work on the project, wouldn’t work on the project at all and would often ghost us in the group chat.
Another big issue of theirs is that they would openly use AI when doing assignments. It would be very noticeable and I or other group members would have to check their work and change it so the teacher wouldn’t get us in trouble. In the beginning of the year the teacher said that if one of uses AI, she would report us to the academic integrity board.
So because of their constant use and other issues states we kicked them out of the group. Since then i haven’t had any issues with Sam but Will has been very passive aggressive after. Giving dirty looks during class and making rude comments under our discussion posts. This all boils down to tonight when he made a comment about our website. Usually I am still very open about feedback and willing to take everything into consideration, however when i read his feedback it didn’t make sense.
He talked about things within our website that were already there or clearly going to be implemented. It also didn’t sound like it was written by him so i went and checked his work twice to make sure i would get a consistent result. It came back as AI. I don’t want to be extra but this is just down right rude. It’s clear it’s AI and i have evidence to support it. Would it be wrong of me to send this to the teacher and report his work to her?",,t3_1gsdjam,AITA
KiteEatingTree,AITA for having a security camera in the living room?,2024-11-14T17:46:34.634000+0000,0,211,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grakfh/aita_for_having_a_security_camera_in_the_living/,"Several months ago I installed several security cameras around the house. In addition to outside cameras, I added one inside overlooking the living room and kitchen. This camera is plainly visible on the ceiling, and it keeps audio and video for several weeks before overwriting. This is the only inside camera, and it only “sees"" the living room and kitchen — no bedrooms or bathrooms are visible.
If someone is visiting for more than just a few minutes or will be alone in the house, then I make sure they know about the camera. I acknowledge I should also hang a cute sign in the living room alerting everyone there is a camera, and I plan to do this.
Several times my partner was over and the camera recorded us having a disagreement. As is typical, there was conflict over what exactly each person said. Afterward I found it very useful to review the recording and get a non-biased perspective of what happened. I even offered to share the recording with my partner and review it together.
When I was a kid, my parents argued constantly about who said what, and I find it comforting to have a recording to reference if there’s any doubt. I think this eliminates gas-lighting, intentional or otherwise.
Here’s the problem. My partner has grown to distrust the recordings and how I might use them. They said they do not give consent and could never live in the house if the camera is allowed to record audio while they are there. I offered to give them the same access to recordings that I have, but that was not acceptable to them.
I know my partner and I need to resolve any issues regarding consent, but am I the asshole for wanting to keep the camera?

TSandD,AITA for getting a customer Kicked out with a bad Yo Mama joke?,2024-11-14T00:07:03.879000+0000,6,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqrol4/aita_for_getting_a_customer_kicked_out_with_a_bad/,"When I (20M) was in college, My dorm was right next to Greek Row, so it was very common for me to run into frat guys. I don't think I need to tell you that they were usually assholes, and I grew pretty tired of having to deal with streakers, drunk guys, and constant harassment toward female dormmates. It sucked.
Fast forward to now. I work at a trampoline park. The last weekend has been a nightmare there. I was stuck with long shifts on our busiest day in months while kids were running around on slides, screaming, bleeding, etc. All of this is to say I was reaching the end of my rope a little bit.
We were about 10 min from closing, and the park was empty except for us, 1-2 families, and a group of high school boys. All day they had been causing trouble. Now, they were bothering my 22F coworker, R. This one guy (D)(18M), was trying to flirt with her, by insulting her makeup and then begging her for her snap. She kept telling D to f off but he wasn't taking the hint.
I was close by when this was all happening, keeping an eye on the other guests. R seemed like she could handle it so I just stayed close in case she needed support.
Eventually, R got fed up and decided to close the park a few minutes early to get rid of D. She had me take over while she went to the intercom. When she left, D started asking me real invasive stuff about R's sex life and of course, also asked me to give him her snap as well. I didn't know R that well and I don't use Snap, but even if I did know any of this stuff I wasn't going to give D anything. So I told him he might have better luck in the dumpster out front.
He started yelling about how I was totally ""hitting that"" with R. At this point, even his friends were getting embarrassed by his behavior and were begging him to chill out. Before anything else happened, R's voice blared out over the speakers, telling everyone that the park was closed. The other guests started filing out, and D's friends had wrangled him enough that he was willing to leave.
Here's where I might be TA. I was riding high watching this dude get so upset that he couldn't get his way. He reminded me of the AHs I had to deal with on Greek Row, and getting 1up felt good. Good enough that I couldn't resist pursuing it just a little bit more.
As D was leaving, I turned towards him, and in a perfectly calm, even tone, I called out to him: ""Be sure to say hi to your mom for me!""
Not the most creative comeback, I know. But it was enough. D went ballistic. He whirled around and started screaming at me, his friends holding him back. His screaming drew everyone's attention, including R, who swooped in and told D off for screaming at an employee. D's friends had to practically drag him out, apologizing profusely.
The whole thing was a great tension reliever. My coworkers laughed at D's reaction, and I'll admit it was cathartic after the shitty weekend we had all had. But as I've reflected on it, I wonder if that was the most mature thing for me to do. AITA?",,t3_1gqrol4,AITA

Last night I received a text from someone in my family that my room back at home has been lived in. Before I left for college, I deepcleaned my room, from from washing all of the bedding, vacuuming, to dusting all of the surfaces, etc. The text said that someone was sleeping in my bed for the past few nights and left everything messy. Socks were left on the floor, the bed was undone with everything askew. I decided to set a boundary by stating that I don't appreciate people just coming into my room whenever they pleased, especially without my permission. The replies that I got were from my older brother ""taking responsibility"" for going into my room and sleeping in my bed, profusely apologizing. The next morning I received multiple messages from my parents saying that I shouldn't have caused ""chaos"" in the family group chat and that my brother wasn't picking up the phone and that he didn't come home from work last night. My parents were telling me that I should just forgive him and move on. When I told them that I didn't think it was right for me to be responsible for his actions, including not coming home, and that if his depression was that serious then just ""being nice"" to him and letting him off the hook was not going to help him at all. I told them that he should seek professional help.
My dad responded that he wants to move on because we are ""going nowhere"" and that I don't know what my parents have been through. I responded to those texts by saying that ""No, i don’t know what you have been through but i know what i’ve experienced. And i do know that every time this kind of situation happens nothing gets resolved because we eventually brush it off. if you want to just move on then fine, it’ll be just a matter of time before another situation happens again and the cycle repeats.""
They blew up over text. They stated that whatever I go through is nothing in comparison to what they go through or what my brother is going through, because of his depression.
Situations like this have happened in the past and everytime they happen my parents just want to move on from it to make my older brother happy. I'm not necessarily close with my parents and I don't often share with them anything that I'm going through because I've never really felt comfortable with talking to them about it. But to read over text, them downgrading anything that I've gone through, especially things that even they're not aware off is upsetting. Was it wrong for me to have sent that text in the group chat?

Successful-Tank-851,AITA for not letting my mom come to my wedding after she ignored me my whole life,2024-11-12T08:42:50.199000+0000,10988,1893,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gpgda7/aita_for_not_letting_my_mom_come_to_my_wedding/,"I (26M) am getting married to my fiancée,(let’s call her Sarah (25F), in a few months, and I’m super excited about it. But there’s one big issue with all the planning—my mom.
A little background: My parents divorced when I was 8, and my mom (let’s call her Layla) remarried pretty quickly after that. She married this guy, Dave, who had two kids of his own. Ever since, it’s like I was no longer a priority in her life. She focused all her attention on Dave and his kids. Like, I’m not exaggerating when I say she treated them way better than me. They’d go on trips, she’d go to all their sport events, and they’d get everything they wanted. Meanwhile, I felt like I was invisible. She didn’t ask about my school, didn’t care about my friends, or even my mental health. I started to feel like I wasn’t even her kid anymore
When I turned 18, I moved out. I thought maybe she’d care and try to stay in touch, but nope—she didn’t. I’d text her once in a while just to check in, and she’d either not respond or say she was busy with Dave and his kids. I figured if she didn’t care, why should I? So, I just stopped trying to reach out.
Fast forward to now. I’m planning my wedding, and out of nowhere, my mom starts texting me like we’re super close. She wants to know all the details, saying how excited she is, and even saying things like, “I can’t wait to see you start this new chapter.” Like… seriously? I haven’t heard from her in years, and now she expects to be front and center for my wedding?
I told her straight up that I didn’t want her there. I said I’m not comfortable with her coming after everything that’s happened, and that if she really wants to have a relationship, we can talk about it after the wedding, but not before. She started crying and saying I’m holding a grudge and that “I’m her son” and “she deserves to be there.” But I don’t know how I’m supposed to just forget the fact that she ignored me my whole childhood in favor of Dave’s kids.
Now, my family is split. Some of them think I’m right and that I shouldn’t just let her show up when she never showed up for me. Others think I should just let it go, and “it’s just one day” and that I should let her come to the wedding to keep the peace.
So… AITA for not letting my mom come to my wedding after everything that happened?",,t3_1gpgda7,AITA

I live with them because I have a chronic disease, and I need someone to be around if I fall ill due to that disease.
A couple of days ago, my sil made some really nice sauce with some chicken and beef. Now I'm not really sure how much meat she used but because I basically wasn't there when she made it or they ate it.
My brother really is the one that eats whatever left over of any food is left or if he doesn't eat it I do. Because my sister in law has told me she doesn't like eating leftover food from the previous day and since this sauce had been a couple days I didn't think she'd want to eat it especially since she was about to cook something else today but my brother advised her not to so we'd instead finish whatever food is left.(they had some fried chicken left too) So my brother was leaving when I asked if he was going to eat the last piece of beef. And he just told me to eat it.
And now I can't help but feel like I've done something wrong by well eating the leftover. I didn't know she wanted to eat and have her go out and buy a snack instead. Please tell me, am I the asshole?",,t3_1gqmpnd,AITA

He had worked for a 1 1/2 months in total. Closer to the beginning of us being together he moved in with me and my roommate and he got a job and we were able to save up for our own apartment in under a month which cost 1400+. We were also able to get some furniture at low prices and luckily family and friends also gave us some furniture. Before we even move in he had quit that job and I told him that he needed to find one asap. Days went by and I questioned him to see if he had applied anywhere and he hadn’t and he used the excuse of “no Wi-Fi at the new place” to apply for jobs in which I understood. He then asked me one day if his friends girlfriend and friend could move in and they would help pay bills and I agreed because I was afraid I would have to do it on my own. I eventually found out his friends girlfriend use to date my now fiancé a couple months before we got together but it didn’t last long, maybe a week or two. That bothered me for awhile but I just chose to ignore it. Long story short they were the absolute worst roommates, I did get pretty close to the female but the partying, drugs , etc was bothering me immensely. I kicked them out a couple months into them living with us and it was a small legal issue that was solved within 2 weeks time. My fiancé still at this point did not have a job. Around the same time my mom got ahold of me and my sister ended up in the hospital for medical reasons, luckily she survived but it hurt me inside knowing my baby sister felt that way and I didn’t know about it. After talking over with my fiancé we both decided to offer to let my mom and two siblings move in. My mom agreed to help with household chores, as well as provide household groceries and other necessities when needed. Which was a bunch of help considering I had been paying bills on my own for awhile. Fast forward to about 6 months later and he still does not have a job. He had a job for 2 weeks, was schedule 10 days but only showed up for 4 and the others he either called off or didn’t show up so he got fired. I keep pushing him to get a job because I can’t keep paying bills on my own, I’m several months behind on electric and gas. My rent is close to 700, I no longer have a working vehicle and it’s too difficult to save up for one on my own. After working 2+ jobs for almost a year my body has shut down and it’s hard to even work one job now where I’m so burnt out. He gets upset because I don’t want intimacy and I can go weeks without it. He constantly plays video games and says he’s trying his hardest but I don’t see how. Our recent issue is his dog whose about 4 years old. I have paid for the dogs food, treats, and toys since we’ve been together. When we first got together someone stole his dog so I tracked down who it was and got his dog back. He cried because he was so happy to see his lost friend but now he wants to get rid of him. I don’t see why because I pay for everything the dog needs. I love and play with him and he feels like my own. My fiancé is starting to hate him because he’ll use the bathroom in the house if he hadn’t been taken out or because he’ll get in the trash if he hasn’t been fed. My issue is the fact that the dog is a really good dog. He listens, knows a few tricks, will let us know if he needs to use the bathroom, but my fiancé doesn’t feed him when he’s suppose to, or take him out. Because my fiancé doesn’t take care of him like he should our dog has been acting up. I told my fiancé that no he can’t get rid of him because that’s his one responsibility and I have several that he hasn’t matched with, and I think it’s unfair for him to get rid of something that I’ve worked so hard for him to have.

I will always put the safety of my child before anything. I think we have some tough discussions ahead of us with my parents. I really needed this support today to stand strong on my convictions. I contacted child care today and my toddler can go full time most weeks for the next few months. My work will give me leave for the rest
Me (38) and my husband (33) have a 2 and a half year old child. We both work full time and one day a week my toddler goes to my parents, the rest of the time she is in child care. This has been going on for over 2 years and my toddler has a great relationship with my parents.
15 years ago my grandmother died and there was some contention about the will. At the time my uncles were basically all trying to sue each other for anything possible. Over the years the estate has basically been worn down to nothing due to legal fees. One uncle has acted especially crazy during this time. Writing and hand delivering threatening letters, stalking the rest of the family at Christmas and at one point slamming open my front door and screaming at me , most of this behavior has been directed at my parents and one other of my uncles. Over the years I have encouraged my parents to report these incidences to the police and they have refused. (costs nothing to make a police report). These behaviors often ebb and flow around court dates or anniversaries, sometimes there is no contact for months and some weeks will be everyday.
Recently as a court date is coming up, the uncles behavior has escalated. He is often sleeping in his car outside houses, been screaming at my parents front door and was pouring round up on pot plants at my uncles house as well as contacting my ex husband. I am worried that he has become unhinged as his behavior is escalating and he has no one and nothing left. I have done the research into what needs to be done including talking to the police to try to protect myself and my family. The police told me that based on his behavior my parents could take out a personal protection order (PPO) against him, all they would need is police reports or evidence of this behavior. I have installed ring doorbells at my parents place to start to gather video evidence, I already have one at mine. I have sent my parents information to get an PPO against my uncle and information about trespassing. I sat down with them and asked them to make police reports for any future events. My father refused and said he doesn’t want to – no reason given. And my mother expressed that she didn’t want to spend the money to serve him with the PPO if granted (less than $200). I said I don’t want my child at their place until something is in place to protect them. My dad responded that I better put my child in for an extra day of care and I walked out.
I am now fully intending to either wear the cost of the extra day of care or use leave to cover the extra day until either a PPO is in place which may take months or years if they continue with their inaction. Other people have told me I am overreacting. WIBTA to follow through on my threat to not take my child to their house until they take action on my uncle.",,t3_1gpuan3,AITA

He'd been sick for a little while and our parents thought he had a flu or something so they didn't get him all the help right away and because of that guilt they devoted every second to him from that point forward. It was supposed to be until he was cancer free. But by the time he was, we were 8 and 6 and they had become so used to focusing on him alone. I spent most of my time with an uncle who lived nearby or neighbors when he was undergoing treatment. My uncle didn't like having me nearby and the neighbors were so busy with their own kids that I got pretty used to being ignored and forgotten. So when my brother was back home and I wasn't sent anywhere anymore I was more used to being alone somewhere and taking care of myself.
My relationship with my parents was never a close one and it's the same with my brother. Both of us feel more like only kids and he gave me shit before for telling our parents I'd like some of their attention too. They'd always tell me he needed it more and he considered me a drama queen. The last time I said anything which was like 3 years ago, he said he didn't realize boys could be as dramatic as girls.
My brother's cancer come back 5 years ago and it was dealt with early and he didn't have treatment for very long and after that he seemed better in all ways. He had more energy, appetite was better and he was doing stuff he'd never had the energy to do before.
About a year ago my mom's parents moved closer to us and they spent time focused on me which bonded me to them pretty quickly. I spend a lot of time with them now. I also took my focus totally off my parents and wanting their attention.
In July my brother's cancer returned again but it's different this time. I wasn't given much info. Treatments are complicated I guess and some other countries have treatments we're not focused on yet so there's talk of him going to Germany and I think Switzerland (but I could be wrong since I don't get much info). My parents are working more hours to help pay for this. And since then I spend even more time with my grandparents. Sometimes spending the night with them. My lack of presence wasn't noticed until they wanted me to help raise the money and maybe offer to get tested if that's what's needed. They said I could start fundraisers and get a job. I already have one but my parents never noticed.
I told them I wasn't going to help with that and it was for the three of them to figure it out. I got yelled at and my grandparents stepped in and said I wasn't responsible for this. My parents were saying it was helping family, my own brother and how could I consider not doing everything to help.

Me and my bf have been together for 2 years, I first met his mom when we started officially dating. She seemed so nice at first, and really made an effort to get to know me.
My first real red flags came up pretty early on but I brushed it off as she had seemed too nice.
He seems to do an unreasonable amount of chores, on top of working really late nights. Once she waited for him to get home at 12pm to ask him to feed the dogs, and had a go at him for the dogs not being fed.
She works an office job from home 5 days a week and has no health issues. There was no reason she couldn’t have just walked to the kitchen and fed the dogs herself IMO.
He hoovers,loads&unloads the dishwasher,deep cleans the bathroom once or twice a month,makes his moms bed and cleans her room,carries and unpacks his and his moms food shopping,feeds and walks the dogs (she never does) cooks dinner for them if she wants something, goes to the shop if she wants milk/bread/wine, and those are just a handful off the top of my head.
I’m not saying that he shouldn’t be doing any chores. But please keep in mind that she doesn’t do any of the above, ever. Even though she’s at home, has no health issues, and has no real reason why she couldn’t IMO. I think it should be balanced.
She also has a weird, almost freudian relationship with him, that makes us both uncomfortable. She calls him hot, tries to make him cuddle her at night if I’m not staying over, ENJOYS trying to walk in on us if she thinks we’re having sex My bf & I also buy own food when we stay over at his mom’s, & I always ask if it’s OK for me to use the shower/electricals/water. I try to be polite and not be any sort of burden.
She recently had a word with me because I ‘left his room a mess’ when I left one evening. She said I let him do everything for me & it s not fair as he works alot. Weird, seeing as she makes him do so much around the house, and I don’t live here it’s not my job to make sure his room is clean. Ofc I’m respectful to his things and space, try to be as clean as possible when I am there, but his own mess is his. I’m not his house maid, and I wouldn’t expect him to be mine.
So, forward to about a month ago, me and my bf mentioned wanting to move out together. She suggested we just move in to his house. We spoke about it, I agreed, going against my better judgement. She asked for £700 rent from us which I think is reasonable as a base. People will have very mixed opinions on that. However, we also would have to contribute to other bills and pay our own food. That on top of bus money, my savings, and my take home, I’m not too open to paying that much right now, which I think is reasonable if I have the option to stay at home and only pay £100 rent to my mom. I’ve been thinking more and more, and experiencing more and more of her hostility & passive aggression. I know I don’t want to move in, but it feels like a lose lose.",,t3_1gr7w9k,AITA

I have very little knowledge of car except for how to change my oil. I hate mechanic shops with a passion because they always try to upsell and labor rate is ridiculous, so I avoid them until I catch wind of a major issue. My brother is not very good with money, and sometimes acts before he thinks thoroughly.
I recently purchased my first car for myself, leaving my old car (which is in my grandfather's name and isn't that old [2009]) sitting in my driveway. We were trying to figure out how to sell it when we found out that my brother would be willing to buy it (he and his wife have been paying off debt and were down to one car).
Rewind three months, he was trying to buy it then too to give to a friend who had no car at all. At that time, I told him everything that was wrong with it (all things that were, in his words, no big deal). More recently, the car started pulling a little to the left while braking, but I thought nothing of it since the car never had an issue stopping when you pushed the brakes.
Since he's family, my grandfather said we should give it to him for free, which I was ok with because even if we sold it I was going to give all the money to my grandfather anyway. My grandfather got the title, signed it, and gave it to me to take to him with the car.
We agree to meet and give him the car. I DRIVE 50~ MILES in the car (he lives out of town) with no issues driving except the pulling to the left thing. We meet and exchange the car. He calls after he gets home to tell me that he had to use the emergency brake to stop all the way home (which has never happened to me in the 8 years I drove the car). He thinks he knows the problem, and proceeds to drop $600 on DIY repairs. He tells me the car is even more undrivable and somehow gets it to a mechanic shop. They inspect it and tell him it needs over $4k in repairs.
He texts me to tell me that I have ""royally screwed"" him and that it was ""not godly"" to give him a car that I ""knew full well as on its last leg (We are both Christians so I don't take that lightly)."" I figured I would take some responsibility for not getting the brake issue looked at myself, so I told him I would drive all the way to the car (90 miles one way) and tow it off to a pick-a-part lot, and whatever money they gave me for it would be his. He tells me no, that the car is in his town already and he would take care of it, and that I need to ""learn from this"" and that he ""won't hold it against me"" because he doesn't want to ""strain any more relationships."" I feel as though, because I was driving the car just fine (still pulling to the left a little) on the day I gave it to him, I did nothing wrong.

I (28F) am still friends with a select few of friends from highschool. The ones that I am still friends will are kinda all intertwined one way or another.
My one friend, Dawn (27F) is in the military and her wife planned to host a going away party for her. She is actually headed to a pretty scary area and will be active active duty in the middle of the desert. Well her wife planned this Party for Jan 1st to coordinate it with New Years and made a Facebook group for it and everything. I RSVP'd that I was going.
Well, a week ago, our other friend, Diane (28F) was drinking and called us saying that she randomly bought us and herself tickets for this concert in the nearby state. She a said she wanted to make a whole trip out of it and spend a few days there. Dawn reminded Diane that that was the date of her going away party and she wasn't going to make it. Diane then said to me, ""well, then you're going with me."" I said sure.
Fast forward to last night, Dawn called me and requested that I change my plans for the concert and come to her going away party because her and I are close and she just doesn't really want me to no be there. I was nervous to tell Diane since this would severely upset her, so today we had Dawn's wife tell her and as expected, Diane blew up. Calling all of us bad friends, telling me I needed to grow up and that I'm almost 30 and I'm shady. She went on to continue to call all of us bad people and stating that she just lost all of her friends.
Come to find out now, that she already asked someone else to go with her to the concert but she still is making our lives hell.
Am I the asshole for choosing to go to this going away party over going to a concert?
Just something to add, and maybe this is moreso to justify it to myself but Diane and I are going to 2 other concerts in February and this should be the last time Dawn enlists so this is her last going away party, and (heaven forbid) if she were to pass away while on duty. I guess what I'm saying is, there will always be more concerts but you never know if you'll get another going away party for your best friend?",,t3_1gqogto,AITA

Later in the night the 16 year old came and asked me if he could have some of the sorbet and I told him to take some but leave at least half because his brother wanted it.
Now this morning the 21 year old found that a third of the sorbet is gone and he threw a huge temper tantrum, waking the whole house up at 4 am and yelling about HIS sorbet and how dare his brother eat some of it. Then he said that because his brother ate some that means he can take the tub of vanilla and chocolate and nobody else should get any. He actually threw the whole 2 litre tub of vanilla ice cream over the fence into the neighbour's yard.
Right now he is still ranting about it saying IATA for allowing his brother to take some of the sorbet.

Mundane_Brilliant_14,AITA for expecting Mom to get me a new birthday present after she ruined the old one?,2024-11-14T21:04:13.348000+0000,0,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grf8am/aita_for_expecting_mom_to_get_me_a_new_birthday/,"For my birthday, Mom bought tickets for my friend and I, both 14F, to go to a haunted house. But when we got there, the haunted house people said we couldn't go in without an adult because their insurance company wouldn't let them. I called Mom and asked her to come with us. Then she showed up with her ""boyfriend"" and said they wanted to go because the haunted house would be ""fun."" I told them we didn't want to spend our time in the haunted house with them, so we should split up after we got in the haunted house. Mom said she wouldn't do that because that would be against the rules. She doesn't mind breaking the rules when she's on the highway going twenty above the speed limit. I took it as a slighte.
My friend and I agreed that once we got in we'd make a run for it, then hide somewhere and let them continue on, thinking they were chasing us. It worked like a charm but they reported us to the haunted house people who found us and kicked us out. I was fuming! But it gets even worse! Mom and her ""boyfriend"" went back into the haunted house and, as soon as she got home, told me how much fun they had just to rub it in my face. I told her that since she ruined my birthday present, she owes me another one. The only other ""birthday presents"" were 20$ and a new pair of shoes. In my mind, a pair of shoes doesn't even count as a birthday present. What's next? Your birthday present is electricity, clean water, and the ability to go to school? She told me I was a spoiled rotten brat and said she wished she could take the 20$ she gave me back, thankfully I had already spent the money. I haven't given up on it and am continually asking what my present will be. I told her I will still be demanding my birthday present when she's eighty-five years old dying in a nursing home.",,t3_1grf8am,AITA
Time_Vermicelli1089,WIBTA If I Ask My Friend About My Role In Our Group?,2024-11-14T11:18:56.515000+0000,0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gr2kha/wibta_if_i_ask_my_friend_about_my_role_in_our/,"Hi, there. I (22F) is now in her final year of uni and is just doing her thesis. However, lately, I've been questioning my old friend group back in highschool. You see, I was in a group with 6 people, 3 girls and 3 boys (all same age). And, here's the thing, my former closest friend, lets call her NA (22F), was in a relationship with someone in the group, AJ (22M). I, too, was in a relation (well, it wasn't like dating but romantically linked) with AR (22M). However, AR and I broke up 3 months later and because of a mistake I made (yes, I took it emotionally and wasn't thinking right) and I throw water at him. Not long after that, I was kicked out of the group. All this happened in 10th grade.
However, in 11th grade, most of them befriended me again and I was like ""Okay, cool"" as in, I have my friends. And, then....it gets worse. However, the worst part really isn't the main topic (maybe for another time because it isn't relevant imo) but one of them, I think it was NA who told me that the group felt kinda empty without me because I was like the glue who can stick everyone together.
These past few nights, I kept questioning myself if I was ever a member of the group or if I was just a sidelined member/outsider of the group as there are many instances I recall back where I felt like that and felt lonely. Second, I keep second guessing myself If I was a member or was just a glue because of that confession alone. Third, I started to wonder if the group was ever a family since the word family was used in our group name. Why I've been wondering about this is due to my current group (yes, we're kinda doing our own thing rn because most of us are in our final year) relationship, where I don't feel like just the glue and I do feel like I am a part of the group. And the term family was used after our internship ended (yes, we met and work together in our internship. sorry forgot to add that).
Since then, I've tried reaching out to 2 people from that group, AR and NZ. As for now, only AR had given me the answer and NZ hasn't. Another person I tried to reached out is RT (22F) and I feel like since we used to go to the same uni and live kinda close, I choose to talk it out with her. But something in me tells me not to do it. Heck, I don't even know now If I should ask her. What do you think, Reddit? WIBTA if I ask my friend about my role in the group? If you guys wants to call me the AH/NTA, It's okay and I can understand the criticism. I'm looking for the right direction for this one. Sorry if this is too long or too hard to understand because it really is kinda complicated. If there's any questions, please do comment down here
EDIT: Hey, all. I don't know if everyone have read the recent comment, so I'm just gonna add in here. I have decided NOT to press to my friend about this. Thank you so much for the insight and opinions. This has been something I've been way overthink about ha ha. Guess should not let the overthinking mind of mine gets the better of me. Again, thank you for the feedback. Very much appreciated. I think I'm going to delete it in 48 hours. Thank you once again as this is just for personal insight so I can navigate my overthinking ha ha
EDIT 2: Hi, Everyone. It is kinda overwhelming seeing a lot of people navigate me through this overthink of mine haha. Bet, hey, overthink must have happened due to some things right?? Well, is it okay if I explain it in a bit?? It's okay if this continues with people calling me an AH, just as long as it's not my friends. And, I'm here for an open ears haha.
The reason why I've been overthink these past few nights about this is because of a moment in my new group where it felt like...how do I say it? You know when you felt like you're in a group where, even without telling, they accepts you to be a part of the group just based on how they treat you? That is exactly how I feel. And second, why I start to overthink is because by now, I kinda see how in my previous group, I feel like I'm the only excited one, the one who puts all of her energy and efforts into it, while the others are sorta....there. I don't want to be that person, but somehow, in my current new group, I feel like my efforts and energy are as equal, if not, was reciprocated by them. Hence, why I start questioning all these. And lastly, there are instances where I realized, which still haunts me to this day, that I think I was kinda lonely in my previous group. So basically, these three points are the highlights. Again, I'm open to criticism and questions if anyone wants to ask. No worries, I'm not gonna hate y'all for this ha ha. It feels good to know someone can help me navigate this overthink-mess-kin-of. So, thank you once again. Appreciate every single one of you.
Oh, before I forgot. It's not about the title I was questioning about, but rather was I a friend/a part of them this whole time? Or was I used just to glue them all together this whole time. That's like the short gist of it. Again, thanks everyone.",,t3_1gr2kha,AITA
Ok-Situation9459,AITA for wanting swap properties but not provide my sister any cash?,2024-11-13T22:44:22.494000+0000,5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqputk/aita_for_wanting_swap_properties_but_not_provide/,"Background: I put the mobile home(MH) in my name for my mom, my sister, and her kids in 2006. My mom paid the mortgage until her passing in 2013. The plan was for my sister to take over the payments after she got back on her feet. Over ten years later, I am still paying the mortgage. I would also like to add, my wife and I have been covering the property taxes on my sister's portion of the land. In 2021, my siblings, cousins and I inherited our grandparents' farm. We all agreed that we wanted to keep the land in the family. I did tell my sister that if she wants to sell some of her land, then we can get it signed over in her name and she can then do whatever she wants. She admitted that she doesn't want to get any assets put in her name to avoid the possibility of it being seized and/or she would lose all of her state benefits. She hasn't worked since around 2005 and has almost $90K in student loan debt.
Since moving out here, my wife and I have been working on several approaches to building a small farm business. We have found a number of USDA loan and grant programs that would really help us get started. However, we've hesitated to apply because trying to get grants or loans for a 5 acre farm isn't really viable. She asked if this would be an even swap and I feel it is. If we look at it from a tax assessment valuation, the farm land is worth approximately $53K, and the mobile home is valued at $40K. She agreed to trade even though she felt it wasn't fair and if we had we had sold 4 acres, it would have been ""life changing money for her."" I have tried to separate feelings from the situation and look at it from a purely financial perspective. This has been exceedingly difficult for me to do, but even more difficult for my wife. Me paying the mortgage for my sister, even though we couldn't afford it, has been an element of contention in my marriage. My wife says I enable my sister, but I have held the position that all that I have done has been for my niece and nephew, not simply for my sister. If it were up to my wife, she would have been kicked out and the MH sold years ago. However, I have never supported my sister's decision to not work. I most certainly have not supported her decision to let her children go without because she refuses to improve her situation. Which is a motivating factor for this deal. I want to remove all financial ties to my sister. I told her that they could sell the MH and they could get over $100K for it easy. It would give her and her the means to begin afresh. Her response was, ""yeah, we could sell it and get a new car, but we wouldn't have anything to go back to."" This morning I am questioning it all because I want to make sure that when it's all said and done, it was the right choice. So am I the asshole for wanting swap properties but not provide my sister any cash?",,t3_1gqputk,AITA
Brief-Switch-3335,AITA for NOT Canceling Plans With A Friend?,2024-11-14T01:28:20.778000+0000,3,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqtd7l/aita_for_not_canceling_plans_with_a_friend/,"My friend and I bought concert tickets a few months in advance for a show in another city. When it got closer to the event, I ended up having a work commitment that was important to me and didn't want to take time off for this concert, as it was a limited contract and I really needed the money. My friend is in law school, which isn't the easiest to take time away from but she does it quite often with enough ease.
I ended up telling her I did not want to go, as it is not in my best interest to take the time off work, as I would be missing out on a lot of money, as well as paying a ton of travel expenses to see the show. I was also not in the right headspace for personal reasons and tried to convey these points to my friend, as they were very important to me. I told her I would give her my ticket for FREE to give to someone else who would want to go more than me, because I saw the best case scenario being that she would still have someone to go with and I wouldn't have to go, even if I lost out on a few hundred bucks.
She didn't end up asking around for someone else to go with, and when I continued to tell her that I didn't want to go she angrily kept telling me how much that sucked and other aggressive language through the phone. The concert was something she was really looking forward to for these months to help with the stress of law school and a challenging time she was going through.
I did not want to go, as I had told her, but also didn't want to let her down. So I did end up making the very far trip out, and even picked her up which was way out of my way, as she lives in a different city entirely. I ended up having two painful 15 hour days of travel, putting over 2000km on my car, and paying hundreds of dollars on ubers and bars that she wanted to go to.
I did have fun, but it was not worth it, in my opinion, for me to make the trip. I told her this, when asked, and it made her incredibly upset. I know now that I should have just stuck to my gut feeling and not gone on the trip, and of course my decisions are my own and no one else's fault, but I gave up a lot and went very far out of my way to try to not let a close friend down, and now she is probably even more upset than if I had just canceled.

Square-Eye-3633,AITA if I don’t want to meet my friends new boyfriend because of his past and present behaviour?,2024-11-13T22:31:21.192000+0000,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqpk2w/aita_if_i_dont_want_to_meet_my_friends_new/,"My roommate and I (26F and 27M) have a very close friend (26F) who has recently, around September, got a new boyfriend (25M). We see our friend multiple times per week and have done for years without problem. Since she’s been with her new partner, she has become much more anxious, withdrawn and has told us that things have been consistently very rocky between them. She has also told us that her boyfriend, who we haven’t met yet, has tried to stop her from seeing us a number of times and has negative reactions every time she makes plans without him.
A few weeks back, we planned a trip to the theatre last minute, and the new boyfriend told our friend that if she came to the theatre with us, they were over. This was because, according to her, he doesn’t deal well with last minute changes of plan and because he feels like we should be including him in our plans, even though we don’t yet know him or his interests. There has genuinely been no intent on leaving him out of plans, because we wanted to wait for our friend to initiate a meeting before suggesting things ourselves.
She put her foot down with him and came with us to the theatre that night. She told us that they came very close to splitting, but that she gave him another chance because it was still early days. In the weeks since, things have mostly gotten better and seem to be improving, which we are pleased to see.
However, a few nights ago, our friend asked whether we would like to meet her new boyfriend soon. Given how rough things have been between them so far, we said that we’re not quite ready yet and that we’d prefer to meet her new boyfriend after a few more weeks of smooth sailing between them. She has previously told us that despite her concerns about how quickly things were moving, he’d still introduced her to all of his friends and that he was now putting pressure on her to introduce us to him.
She understood our feelings and fed back to her boyfriend that after they’d had a few more weeks to settle in with each other, she’d look to introduce us. Her boyfriend took this very badly, and has now accused us of isolating him and excluding him, even after having the reasoning for our decision explained to him.
I believe he’s having this reaction in an attempt to get what he wants, which is to meet us soon. Our friend seems willing to accommodate his desire to meet us soon, but we think she’s only willing to do this to avoid further arguments with her partner, rather than it being her genuine want. We also feel, as the honeymoon phase hasn’t exactly been rosy, that for us to bend to his will would be to legitimise potentially coercive and controlling behaviour, especially from someone who already seems to have taken a personal issue with us because we haven’t given him what he wants.
Are we the assholes? Are we being too harsh, or are we right to be reluctant to meet this man?",,t3_1gqpk2w,AITA
Cupsofnoodles5,WIBTA for expressing that I don't want a tree cut down in my boyfriend's yard?,2024-11-13T13:46:50.102000+0000,27,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqd8nu/wibta_for_expressing_that_i_dont_want_a_tree_cut/,"So I (30F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for 4 years and we have lived together for over 2 years, we do have 2 children under the age of 9 and while he is not their biological father, for all intents and purposes he is their dad.
His neighbors, a married couple (50 ish M&F) are like family to him and I also love them, they want to have all 3 trees in his back yard cut down as they have a pool (that we have an open invite to use) and are tired of dealing with the leaves every year, understandable. They are also going to pay to have them cut down.
The issue is that one of the trees (second largest tree) has a swing on it that one of the children use often and will sometimes spend hours on, the child is also special needs and doesn't like change, and while they have offered to build a frame for the swing afterwards, it would not be able to swing all around freely anymore without hitting a frame like it currently is which is one of the things my child loves about it and also without the tree the rather large yard would be completely hit by the sun with no shade protection which is concerning when the child spends so much time outside, the tree currently provides a lot of shade over the swing area where my child plays the most. I feel like we have a right to have at least one tree in the yard, and I am also concerned that the neighbors are using the fact that my boyfriend is so nice and that they are so close with him, against him, as they've asked several other neighbors to cut down their trees and they've all refused but they know my boyfriend won't refuse, they didn't even really ask, just said they were going to have them cut down. They are good people though and I don't know if they would actually think that way.
They also have stated multiple times that they don't plan on living here forever and want to eventually sell their house to move somewhere warmer. I also don't believe my boyfriend would ever have them cut down if they didn't want it.
Here's where I might be the asshole, this is not my house or my tree, my boyfriend had this house before we were together, he pays the mortgage and bills and he is the one that cleans up the leaves, while I don't work any money I do get pays for all the children's needs and groceries but not any bills, I don't feel I have a right to ask for this tree to not be cut down and also I feel I would be an asshole for stating my feelings as it would make my boyfriend feel guilty for having to choose to either make myself or his neighbors happy, and these neighbors would most likely do any favor we asked of them and even help out with the children if asked so I also don't want to upset them either. Not to mention paying for the trees to be cut down and building a frame for the swing after are all very generous.
So would I be the asshole for expressing that I do not want one of the three trees cut down?",,t3_1gqd8nu,AITA
blueCommodity,AITA for caring about my pet?,2024-11-14T01:16:31.770000+0000,3,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqt4pl/aita_for_caring_about_my_pet/,"Am I the asshole? Me (31F) was raised by my grandparents my whole life. When I was 8, we adopted a cat because I always begged for one. But my grandparents were from an “older generation”, and since I was a kid, the cat would roam outside against my wishes. He lived for 8 years, and no loss I’ve ever experienced has surpassed what I felt when he passed away.
Then in 2013, I adopted another cat, and as an adult, I took 100% responsibility for him: feeding him dye-free food, regular vet check-ups, protective screens on windows, and no going outside. A few years later, I moved to a big city for work and have been here for a while. To avoid stressing this cat, who’s been with my family for years, I left him with them.
A few key points here: I love cats a lot. I don’t plan on having kids, and I understand that a mother’s love for a child is different from an owner’s love for a pet, but my cats are the most important thing in the world to me.
It’s also important to note that I lived with my grandparents because my parents were teenagers and were never really present. Sometimes they were physically there but never took on the responsibilities of parents—like educating, buying clothes, attending school meetings, and so on. Even now, with them having others kids, they still only seem to care about themselves.
My mom married a rich man because all she cares about is money. She’s never worked a day in her life and believes people’s value is based on what they have, not who they are. My dad has bankrupted my grandparents several times because he never wanted to work and still lives with them, dreaming of becoming a writer (even though he’s never contributed anything to the household and is almost 50).
The point is: yesterday, this 11-year-old cat had an accident involving his paw due to nodules and bled a lot; he even needed a blood transfusion. Since I live in another city, I only found out because my dad posted on social media, saying the cat had ‘scared him,’ that he has “only 5 years of life” and fucking scaring things, but he still made a point to mention that he went to the movies WHILE the cat is bleeding all over the house and even posted a review of the film. I argue with him that it was very insensitive and…he blocked me. When I told my mom about this, she said she doesn’t understand people’s feelings toward pets and that she has bigger problems, not even wanting to listen to me.
I called my grandparents to ask why they didn’t tell me the cat was hospitalized. They said they didn’t want to worry me, but they apologized and promised it wouldn’t happen again.
So here’s the question: am I the asshole for being upset that my dad posted photos of the cat just for likes, even though he went to the movies during an emergency? And for being mad at my mom for just saying, ‘I don’t get the love for pets’ and not even trying to comfort me?",,t3_1gqt4pl,AITA

It would be in the same city. However, she started giving me one-word answers and didn’t check up on our status. Time passed and I ended up needing to take a train up to the city. I FB messaged her, “If you’re not open to having me tag along, then just let me know so I could find a different approach since you weren’t communicative with me.” She later replied asking why I had to be so specific about these extra details and if it was necessary for her to check up on me to see if I was even ready or where to pick me up. I ended up leaving them on read by accident since I got busy and meant to respond back.
Today, she messaged me we shouldn’t be friends anymore and unfriended me. I was so taken aback by this and didn’t expect things to go that way. I just told her if this is how she feels about our friendship, then she has a right and to take care of herself. I’m also like we have been friends for 2 years, but this is not the direction I expect to see. We would be still be going to the same city, just different neighborhoods.

Valuable-Deer7829,AITA for walking away from and “leaving” my friend at a festival?,2024-11-13T14:59:54.376000+0000,17,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqes1j/aita_for_walking_away_from_and_leaving_my_friend/,"I tried to keep this somewhat short but it ended up being long, sorry! I 19F went to a festival with a group of 9 friends, including my boyfriend. I invited along Abby (fake name) and her boyfriend and everyone else was a close friend and couples as well.
We get there and it’s a madhouse. About halfway through our time there, half of the group walks off together to go explore either by themselves or with their partner. At this point it’s just me, my bf, Abby, her bf, and her bf’s friend. We’re all trying to decide what to do to get food. My bf and I didn’t say anything and we were just standing there listening to them decide. So, the three of them walk off to get into the food line. My bf and I decide not to follow, and instead go to an ATM to get cash for food, therefore splitting off from the three.
I should make it known that my decision was partially made because I had a slight feeling that Abby’s bf and his friend were making fun of me the entire day. Whenever I’d make a joke or be loud because I was around my close friends, they’d sort of make a face at each other or try not to laugh. This was annoying me, so that went into my decision to walk off.
Two days later I’m sitting in the car with my other best friend and I express to her that I felt like said boyfriend and friend were making fun of me during our outing. She says “oh that make sense” and proceeds to show me a paragraph that Abby had sent to her, my best friend, about how I apparently did something wrong. It was along the lines of “I’m not sure how to say this but (my name) left me and my friends in the middle of the festival without saying anything, and when I tried to find her she wouldn’t text me back!” Nobody had any service btw.
I’m sitting there pissed and upset, because a girl that I thought was my friend walked off without me, then decided to blame me for “leaving her” at the festival and text my best friend behind my back trying to talk shit about my actions instead of just talking to me. I felt like I was a hypocrite at first because I expressed the making fun thing to my best friend and that’s sort of talking behind backs, but I realized that I was expressing myself, while Abby was texting saying “(name) DID THIS…” as an accusation.
The text wasn’t even trying to solve anything. It was literally just accusing me of being a bad friend and trying to talk shit about me. 1) I’m the only one in our friend group that’s been trying to keep her involved in our plans and 2) she hasn’t once hit me up herself to hang out, so our friendship has felt one sided. Lastly, 3) I was the one person in our friend group actually vocalizing and worried about finding her to give her a ride home, because none of us had service. The. Only. One. Talking about finding her, And amongst all these one sided feelings, she does this. AITA?",,t3_1gqes1j,AITA

At first, I said yes because, well, he’s my brother, and I felt bad for the guy. But when I asked for the basics—like how long he planned to stay and if he’d chip in for rent or utilities—Jake lost it. He called me “cold” and accused me of treating him like a stranger instead of family.
The thing is, Jake has never been the most reliable guy. He’s got a track record of dodging responsibilities and leaving others to pick up the slack. Case in point: I loaned him $2,000 a few years ago, and I’m still waiting to see a single penny back. I don’t want my apartment turning into Jake’s personal pity party, where I bankroll his bad decisions while he binges Netflix on my couch. So, I told him no. Now, Jake’s furious and blowing up my phone, calling me selfish, while our parents are guilt-tripping me with lines like, “He’s your brother; he needs you.” Funny thing—they aren’t exactly offering their spare rooms either.
So, AITA for refusing to let my brother move in? I get that he’s struggling, but I don’t think my place is a free rehab center for his life choices. Am I being a bad brother, or just protecting my sanity?",,t3_1gueool,AITA
leprechaun_dong,AITA for telling my pregnant friend I can’t stand her complaining anymore? ,2024-11-18T14:43:23.802000+0000,3651,578,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gu6a07/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_friend_i_cant_stand/,"I want to start off by saying that I (F29) am 7 months pregnant myself. My friend Cassie (25F) is also pregnant, and about 7 weeks ahead of me.
At first it was awesome being pregnant together— we’d vent about things, talk about how excited we are, plan mommy-to-be dates, etc. But now her attitude has been rubbing me the wrong way and I can’t stand talking to her about it anymore.
She’s gone from occasional venting to texting me upwards of 5 times a day about every horrible symptom she has. What bothers me is that I also have a lot of the same irritating pregnancy symptoms, but when I try to sympathize she pulls the “oh just WAIT until you’re at _____ weeks!” card as if it’s some strange competition.
So I dropped the sympathy angle and decided to just send her positive messages instead. But she totally sidesteps my attempts at positivity or my suggestions and complains about something else. For example, if I suggested a medicine I took for heartburn she’d reply “no I’ll just throw it up.” If I tried to suggest that she take some time off work because she’s clearly unhappy, she’d reply “I can’t I don’t have enough sick days.” Which is fair, I guess, but it gets old very quick being shot down over and over. She ignores all my upbeat messages about staying strong and that she’s almost there and that she can do it and replies with “I’m miserable” instead.
What pushed me over the edge is she also stopped asking me about my pregnancy completely. Never checks in with me, never asks about my baby, and when I try to share anything positive she hardly acknowledges it. I went from feeling like we were in this together to feeling like she is the only pregnant one. I finally snapped when she texted me about her swollen ankles for the 20th time and said that I’m already anxious enough with my own due date creeping up and that her negativity is ruining my own pregnancy. I told her that I’m not feeling great either, but I’m not sending her lists of ailments every morning and I suggested she start venting to her husband instead.
I obviously hurt her feelings— she read it and hasn’t spoken to me since. I feel completely justified, but my husband said I shouldn’t have said anything, that she’s “clearly struggling more”, and that I should just basically treat her with pity because she’s so unhappy. I think she’s a total downer and I don’t need that energy weighing me down, but now I’m wondering if I’m being insensitive because she is so close to giving birth and clearly having more complications than I am.

Easy-Remove-1492,AITA for telling another customer in a restaurant that it was disgusting to let her dog smell other people's food?,2024-11-18T19:36:26.380000+0000,860,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1guddz9/aita_for_telling_another_customer_in_a_restaurant/,"For background: (Let me preface this by saying that I love dogs, just not next to my food.) I was picking up my food from a popular salad chain in NYC when I noticed that another customer was in there with her dog. She was holding her dog up -- it wasn't on the ground or in a bag-- and it's face and paws were all up in people's food pickup orders. It's a dog so it was sniffing. I get it, dogs are curious especially around food. But I also saw the dog outside before going in and saw that the dog urinated on the ground prior to going into the restaurant and that it's paws stepped into its own urine. I was disgusted to see that its paws were so close to the food, in addition to its face sniffing all around everyone's food. I noticed that not all of the lids were fully covering the food waiting for pickup. I told this person that I thought it was disgusting to hold her dog up so close to everyone's food. I left the restaurant and she followed me outside basically harassing me. She said that her dog was a service dog. I told her I didn't know what that had to do with the fact that she was holding her dog up to other people's food and that was still disgusting for people who are picking up their own food orders. I asked why she couldn't just put the dog on the ground or in a bag when she went inside the restaurant, but she just kept repeating that it was a service dog. I realized that I wasn't going to get through to her with my point so I left, but she just kept shouting at me as I was trying to walk away.

Spirited-Flamingo868,AITA for not letting my Grandmother stay with me after she let me stay with her during the hurricane?,2024-11-18T19:54:46.413000+0000,764,709,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gudtvv/aita_for_not_letting_my_grandmother_stay_with_me/,"I have a feeling the animal lovers are going to hate me.
I (31f) stayed with my grandmother (76f) during Milton, as my home was where the hurricane hit. I do not make a lot of money, and I live in a mother-in-law home I rent from her, meaning its a very small space behind a house with only two doors inside: to the bathroom and the closet. There are no other doors in the entire place, everything is open and easily accessible. This is important.
My grandmother is obsessed with her two large dogs. They're boxers, fully grown, very smart, hyper, and destructive. I own a LOT of expensive equipment for work, at least $6k worth, as well as emotional attachments sent by my long distance partner that can never be replaced if lost or destroyed.
She lives a little under 2 hours away, and each time she comes down, she wants to stay the night because shes getting to that age where long drives aren't feasible. I don't really like people coming into my space, but will allow her to stay because she's done so much for me-as long as she gets a dog-sitter and the dogs stay back at her house. She has one, and uses them often to go on mini-trips.
She says these dogs are like her children, and I'm an asshole for forcing her to 'choose' because they make her feel safe and relaxed. Her argument is that 80% of the time when she comes down here, it's for me-being evacuations, family vacations, etc, since I don't drive due to PTSD. I've tried to offer to pay for the sitter, but she ignored the offer.
The thing is, I cannot deal with the labor of keeping these hyper dogs from destroying EVERYTHING. I cannot fit all my valuables into my closet, nor should I have to because I still need to work and its my space I pay for. I don't want to have to dog-proof my house just for a night and have to climb over makeshift barricades of chairs, dressers, etc. She thinks it'd force me to clean my space better (she has OCD), and doesn't see reorganizing my entire small home to be dog friendly as a problem since its so small.
It has been almost a month now and she is still upset at me over not letting her stay, and mentioning that she wanted to stay at the end of this month since we're going on vacation together, but she refuses to leave her dogs at home. I know she does a lot for me, but the last time they stayed got...really tense and ended in a nasty fight, which started the rule.
I am neutral to dogs, I'd even say I like some of them, but her dogs make me neurotic. The entire time they're around, especially in spaces that I'm in, they just start licking me, chewing on my stuff, and try to mow over me or her to get into areas that I've had to make-shift barricades for since...NO DOORS. I'd rather cancel the whole vacation than to let her stay with her dogs for that one night because just the 4 hours caused so much havoc, overnight will probably end our relationship since I'd be on their ass the entire time. So, AITA?
EDIT: I'm unsure if this'll work, I apologize if it doesn't. Minus the loads of really mean comments, I did get some great advice and took it. We just finished having a serious talk, and will be looking into booking her a hotel whenever she comes down and needs a place to stay. Yes, I am paying. It seems like shes been wanting to stay longer for personal stuff, but didn't want to take her RV down here and was hoping to ask for 'one more day' until she was done, but my hard no for one night made her realize that wouldn't be an option. Thank you to all who were willing to give meaningful perspectives!",,t3_1gudtvv,AITA
HonestFan9099,AITA for refusing to go to Thanksgiving because of my mom’s boyfriend?,2024-11-18T20:32:37.858000+0000,632,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gueqtm/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_thanksgiving_because/,"My mom Lisa (56F) and I (17F) have a rocky relationship. I’m close with my older brothers, Max (35M) and Alex (30M), but we have different dads. My parents divorced when I was 3, and I’ve never had a stable father figure. My mom remarried when I was 4 to a man who was emotionally abusive and caused me a lot of trauma. They divorced three years ago, which was a huge relief for me.
A few months ago, my mom started dating again. Her first boyfriend, Bobby, was nice, but she broke it off quickly, saying she “never really liked him.” Then she started dating her current boyfriend, Mike, about two months ago. The first time I met him, he handed me the keys to my first car—a car I paid $2,000 for, with the rest from my mom and grandma. It felt weird and awkward, like he was trying to act like a dad.
Mike didn’t make a good impression on my family either. At Max’s recent 35th birthday brunch, Mike spent the whole time talking about himself and his kids, ignoring Max entirely. My mom spends most of her time at Mike’s house now, leaving me to cook and grocery shop for myself. I’ve told her I’m not ready to get to know him because of my trauma from past “father figures,” but she calls me selfish, even though I’ve been in therapy since I was 8.
Now, my mom and Mike are hosting Thanksgiving, but Max and his family aren’t coming because they don’t like Mike. I told my mom I’d rather spend the day with Max and his kids, and she accused me of being selfish and disrespectful. I’ve always wanted a good stable family and spending Thanksgiving with a man I barely know and his children is not my ideal scenario. Especially after spending everything Thanksgiving as a child with my crappy stepdad.

ExperienceFrosty457,AITA for not apologising to my brother after he missed my birthday,2024-11-18T12:15:44.100000+0000,2681,442,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gu3d5m/aita_for_not_apologising_to_my_brother_after_he/,"I (30f) have always loved celebrating my birthday. My parents were not amazing parents but my Mum always made sure on our birthdays a big deal was made.
I got married quite young (21) and didn't have a lot of money at the time so our wedding was very cheap, it was even BYO. I still loved it but always regretted not being able to pay for a big meal for everyone. So for my 30th, because I'm in a way better financial position, I wanted to do something where I paid for everyone's food and drink and we all had fun.
I told everyone about it months in advance as I had to pre pay for the venue and let them know about catering. It got to a month before my birthday and my brother (26m) hadn't RSVPd yet so I messaged him to ask. He said that he wouldn't be coming as him and his girlfriend had just bought a puppy and could not leave the puppy unattended that long. I responded asking him if there was no one else that could look after the dog to which he responded the dog was ""his responsibility not anyone elses"".
I explained to him how upset I was as it felt like he wasn't even trying to come. He said he didn't see what the big deal was and I always make him uncomfortable by guilting him about stuff like this. For context, I have gotten mad at him before for not attending my son's birthday party and not letting me know he wasn't coming. We argued a bit about other history thats not relevant. What made me mad more than anything was his complete inability to empathise. He made me feel like I was being the difficult one for being upset with him.
5 years ago I would have lost it and told him to get out of my life forever but I've done a lot of therapy in that time and I simply said I wasn't going to let him make me feel bad for having a valid response to my own brother missing an important birthday to me. I said I needed a break from talking to him so I could enjoy my birthday and I loved him. We left it at that.
It's been 6 months, it is now coming up to my sons birthday and I sent him an invite as I don't believe in withholding my kids from someone because I'm mad, my parents did that a lot. He hasn't responded and when my Mum asked him if he was coming he said he was waiting on a conversation with me first.
In my family that means I will be the one that has to call and he will expect me to apologise for being upset with him or he won't come to my son's birthday. He is more stubborn than I am so it will have to be the way it goes for him to come. AITA if I just don't apologise and continue the stalemate?
EDIT: For those saying I'm upset over parties, it's not the party I'm upset about. If he had offered to do something else with me instead or even have me over to meet his dog and watch a movie I honestly wouldn't have been upset.
The whole cutting people my life over petty stuff is to do with highschool friends and a couple of aunts where I acknowledged I was doing the wrong thing so went to therapy to change that.
I have never acted that way with my brother, my parents divorced when he was 12 and wouldn't stay in the same room together so I went to his Deb, graduation, sporting games to support him as I wanted him to have someone consistent in his life. The ""irrelevant history"" was us arguing over who was stuck between my parents more which we both agreed by the end of it that we had veered off track.
The ""guilting him"" about my son's party was simply that I cried when we spoke about it which made him feel uncomfortable, I ended up apologising for crying which is why I say I'm afraid to apologise this time as I'm so used to apologising for having emotions which I don't think is healthy for me
I do agree with some that as I broke off contact I should have been the one to initiate it again but I thought sending him the invite was doing that",,t3_1gu3d5m,AITA
HelloIAmHereLOL,AITA for telling my older sister that I dont want to babysit her anymore?,2024-11-18T14:46:16.594000+0000,1045,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gu6cbf/aita_for_telling_my_older_sister_that_i_dont_want/,"English is not my first language
So I (F18) have a sister (21). Four years ago she started to have issues with her thyroid. I dont know the details, but I know that she often passed out in school, as a result of her medical condition. She developed a deep depression and even when her condition got better after a surgery her depression remained. Even when she got a therapist.
She graduated in 2023 and has been at home ever since. She doesnt work and doesnt seek further education. She just sits in her bed all day. She also refuses to do any chores, except for feeding some of our pets.
I graduated in July 2024. I am also still at home, but I work a part-time job and I am studying to get my drivers lisence. I plan on going to university in late spring. But even with my jobs I spend more time at home than I used to. Thats why I took over most of the chores. My father works full-time and doesnt come home before 7pm. My mother used to work full-time but now reduced her hours to help out with my sister.
I also have to take care of her. I have to get her to wake up (that sometimes takes 2-3h), I have to make sure that she eats properly, I try to motivate her to do at least some chores and I have to check on her frequently. She also tries to get my attention for hours by stealing my things and running off, by jumping on my bed and refusing to leave, by smearing my door with soap and toothpaste, by waking up my hamster, etc. I normally react to all that calmly, because I know how she really feels. But I started to get more angry with time, because its just incredibly childish and I dont know how to stop her. She also doesnt leave the house alone. When she wants to go shopping I have to go with her and she constantly begs for me to do things with her. Most of the times I give in.
Her depression is very predictable. A few weeks everything goes great and then after some time (mostly before doctors appointments/ meetings with her therapist) she has a break down. She was send to two clinics for that and when It happened again a week ago she was sent to a third. Monday she got in and Tuesday she was in tears, already demanding to leave. Not a week later they are legally not allowed to keep her any longer.
This happened before. She shows everyone how bad she has it, then everyone moves earth and sun for her to get proper help and there she refuses to get any help and just demands to leave as soon as possible.
My mom and I have to pick her up today from the last clinic. She called me earlier telling me the news. And I told her that I dont support her decision and that her behaviour is unfair for anyone who worries about her and tries to help her. She tells me that this time it wont be like the other times, but she promised that multiple times already and the next time she wont get into a better clinic. We got into an argument and a few minutes in I got really angry and told her that I dont want to babysit her anymore. Now shes calling me an a-hole

AITA-blanket,AITA for making my lesbian daughter’s children blankets?,2024-11-18T04:05:36.776000+0000,9323,555,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gtw8yi/aita_for_making_my_lesbian_daughters_children/,"Throw away account
Basically I (52F) have three daughters, Anne (30F), Carrie (26F) and Jane (20F). All fake names.
When all my girls turned 18, I made them a special blanket. I then made three swaddle blankets out of the same materials for their future children. Carrie told me not to because she didn't want kids. I found out later it was because she's a lesbian. I said okay, but made them just in case.
Earlier this year, Carrie married her lovely wife, Rory (28F). Her amazing daughter Diane (5F) is my third grandchild. I approached Rory and asked if I could give her one of the blankets I made for Carrie's kids, or if she wanted me to make one special for her out of the materials I used to make their wedding living room blanket. I always give these out on the day they're born, so for Diane I plan on giving it on her birthday and was explaining that to her. She told me to ask Diane. I did, and Carrie overheard.
I found out that she's pregnant because she was crying and yelling that I didn't respect her wishes so how can she trust me with her baby? I'm just so confused and hurt. I was trying to do something nice for all my girls, and then my sweet Diane. Instead of being happy I was cautious, Carrie is threatening to go low contact because I don't respect her and am obviously homophobic because how else would I have thought she'd get pregnant, which is very confusing. Rory is telling me it's hormones and that Carrie is emotional because of how hard it was to get pregnant (I didn't know they had been trying) and that she's afraid she's going to lose it.
AITA? I was trying to be kind. I wasn't being homophobic or trying to be disrespectful.
Edit: I don't know if it's relevant, but I still have material from the blankets for patching, so I was planning on adding to Diane's to make it big enough to use or I was going to let her have it fit her baby dolls. That's what my other two granddaughters do now that it's too small for them.
Edit 2: I didn't know Carrie was a lesbian until she was 23. I had made all the blankets by the time she was 19.",,t3_1gtw8yi,AITA

I (28 F) have been married to my husband (32 M) for ten years. We have 2 beautiful children. I get along really well with his family. I always send them photos of our children and call them so they could talk on phone since they live 6 hours away. So, I mean I really don't want to sound toxic or ungrateful... They come to visit once a month (their whole family lives here, it's just them who live far away). Our house is a 20-30 min drive away from where they stay. They always come to our house unannounced. I never complained to them, though I have spoken to my husband to have a word with his mom. They would come late like 11 at night, and would, in occasions wake up our kids.
I never wanted to make them feel uncomfortable, so I'd always put on a smile and in most occasions, invite them dinner, since because of the drive, they wouldn't eat. My MIL's partner, is really well off. However we never asked them for anything when they would basically invite themselves for dinner.
So, the thing is, since the beginning of our relationship with my husband, they would always only invite him for dinners and outings. It wasn't till our first child turned around 2, that I had a talk with him telling him I felt his family was leaving my child and I apart. Though they would visit, they would only ask my husband to go to dinner with them. After he talked to his mom, everything cleared up.
Till this year. So my husband's job is on the way to my MIL's. Everytime they come visit they come to our home unannounced. Then during that weekend, since it's on his way, they always invite only him to their house. The thing is, that it's not just him they invite. They invite my SIL and my MIL's partner's children and grandchildren. It's just my children and I who don't go. However, they all live at a 10-5 min distance, it's just our family who live a bit farther.
So I told my husband I felt they always left his family behind. He got angry and said that they just invited him because it's convenient and because it's on his way. So AITA and should chill out, or not?",,t3_1gudxir,AITA

Here were some examples from over the years:
Ellie stole a hair ribbon from another girl? The other girl was lying because she was jealous of Ellie.
The teacher gave Ellie an F because she didn’t do the work? The teacher is also jealous of Ellie. (Also yea I know there are bad teachers out there and have had a few myself. But every single one and all the time? Really?)
Ellie’s sister “Annie” hasn’t talked to Ellie since moving out? Nothing happened and Jenny has no idea why Annie is refusing contact. (Jenny is so in denial about this one especially. Something obviously happened that Jenny doesn’t want to admit to.)
Mom notices this too, but she usually just changes the subject away from Ellie but never says anything about it directly to Jenny because she doesn’t want it to hurt the friendship. Jenny usually does take the hint and changes the subject.
Mom took me to a baby shower where Jenny happened to be, so they obviously talked and my mom mentioned that me and my friends have a camping trip planned soon. Jenny was openly hinting that I she wanted me to invite Ellie too. Mom picked up on it and basically tried inviting Ellie along. So before she finished her sentence I loudly said “Oh Hell no!”
Jenny clearly wasn’t happy, and Mom told me that my trip was cancelled. By the time we got home, she luckily changed her mind about canceling the trip but was still pissed at me. I said that her and Jenny have been friends forever, but I didn’t choose to be Ellie’s friend, and didn’t want her coming along.
Mom said she knows I don’t have a great opinion of Ellie and that she knows Ellie has plenty of issues, but I should have declined respectfully instead of embarrassing Jenny and was capable of saying something like “Sorry, I would prefer nobody else come since we don’t have room or supplies for another person/my friends aren’t comfortable with someone they know well coming along”
I realize I could have been more respectful, but I was also trying to put a stop to that immediately. Also, we got some looks, just because I admit I was pretty loud, but everyone outside of Jenny and Mom seemed to move on almost immediately. So I think she’s turning the “embarrassment” into a bigger deal than it actually was. AITA?",,t3_1gumyfy,AITA

You must be really good at being selfish.” Lily was hurt by that comment, and it made her feel like Lindsey was judging our life choices. Most recently, at a birthday party, Lindsey made a comment about Lily’s career, saying, “It’s cute that you’re working part-time with no kids while Josh and I are really focusing on our careers.” Lily was annoyed, but didn’t say anything because she didn’t want to start drama.
Thanksgiving is at our house this year, and when Josh asked if he could bring Lindsey, I told him I’d prefer if she didn’t come. I explained that some of her comments had made Lily feel disrespected, and I didn’t want that to ruin the holiday. Josh got upset and said I was being petty. He argued that I was overreacting and that Lindsey was “just being honest,” but I stood my ground. Now Josh says he won’t come if Lindsey isn’t invited, and my parents are caught in the middle. My mom thinks I’m being too harsh, but I feel like I’m just standing up for my wife. AITA for refusing to let my brother bring his girlfriend to Thanksgiving?",,t3_1gtp5c4,AITA
Calm-Control-8938,AITA for calling out the mom of my kid’s bully during a PTA meeting? ,2024-11-19T01:38:19.225000+0000,41,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gulpkw/aita_for_calling_out_the_mom_of_my_kids_bully/,"My kid is being bullied for her smell and that’s something she can’t control. My kid has TMAU so she sometimes has a fish-like smell. She has to be on a very specific diet and some medicine to at least stop the symptoms since there is no cure for it yet. Unfortunately, I was in between job for months and just recently started with a new one. We heavily rely on food banks since I’m just starting so I cannot provide the diet that I could before nor could afford anti biotics or activated charcoal since I could barely afford to keep our lights on.
i feel like I am to be blamed for all of this since I cannot provide the care that she deserves. She’s the sweetest kid and doesn’t deserve the cruelty that she’s experiencing. I know kids in her school are just kids and would probably wont understand but I tried calling the mom of the kid that my daughter pointed out a week ago but I was blamed for “being a horrible mom” for allowing my kid to smell like that even after I explained the situation. So part of the PTA meeting was talk about bullying and when the homeroom teacher asked a question she answered. My ear just rung and told everyone how much of a hypocrite she was and told everyone about our phone call. I was so upset and just asked to be excused after I said it.
I am working my ass off and trying my hardest to provide but sometimes it feels that it just isnt enough. I’m not trying to complain but everyday I walk to work which is over 40 mns just to save money and I can’t afford it too.
I want to stay strong in front of my kids, but seeing my kid cry just breaks me. We rely on food banks so even if I want to provide the diet that my kid needs, I cannot. Im behind a lot of bills so Im not sure when I’ll be able to actually buy groceries and I feel like a failure not being able to help my kid.",,t3_1gulpkw,AITA

On Sundays, as part of my routine for resetting for the week, I spend the day cleaning through my house. This routine includes cleaning the bed sheets and covers. It was late when I asked my husband to help me with making the bed and when we got to the decorative pillows he told me to leave them on the floor because we would be going to bed in two hours and he'd be the one to take them back off the bed again. I told him I don't care about the timeline or the task, I like the room to be set on Sunday night.

We are launching a new product and I initially hired a videographer to do the video, but the video he made was not good nor what I was looking for so last minute I decided to do the video myself. I needed another person to help me with the filming (as the video could not be filmed on a tripod, tried wasn't happy with the result) the filming would have not taken more than 30-45min. I asked him yesterday morning if he was available to help me the next day, telling him that I need to film it tomorrow and it has to be during the day because of the light. He told me he was free tomorrow and will help me.
Fast forward to today I wait for him to wake up and I ask him what time works the best for him to go and shoot the video, and he tells me that he won't have time today as he just agreed to meet a friend for lunch and afterwards he made plans to play basketball with friends and told me we can do it tomorrow instead. Safe to say I got really angry at him, as he cancelled on me last minute, leaving me in a stupid position where I have to figure our a way to film the video very last minute.
We got in a huge argument he claims that I am overreacting and blowing things out of proportion. While I think what he did is rude and unfair, as he made plans with me prior to making plans with his friends, plus it was work related stuff that he canceled on, and he could have just simple moved meeting with his friend for an hour later or rescheduled it for later that day or the next day.
edit:  I am self-employed and I have a small business (lifestyle/home decor products) and sometimes I require help from other people, I don't have a company of 40+ people. We are only 4 people and everyone is remote. I do the creative work of the company and usually film everything myself with a tripod or hire photographer/videographer. But in this case the videographer I hired didn't do a good job so I was running out of time, I didn't have time for the guy to refilm and reedit the video so I decided to do the video myself and asked my bf for help (last minute). Hope this answers all the questions on what kind of a job I have...",,t3_1guh5ow,AITA

Her grandparents had been married for 60 years, and understandably anxiety and nervousness about being alone can torment a person especially in their time of grief. To help out her grandmother my father in law renovated the basement and made it a studio apartment so to speak. In the time frame of the renovation family members would stay a night away from their own loved ones and spend it with grandma to ease anxiety and loneliness. My wife and myself talked with her grandma about how moving in would go and that yes we will still spend time with her during the week for our weekly dinner and time on the weekend, but we are a young couple we like spending time together. There are hobbies we have that we want to do and we aren’t moving in to be upstairs with her 24/7, we are there to ease her anxiety about nighttime. Three months into the renovation a family friend moved in as he was on the split from his partner. He spent a majority of his time when not working in the living room watching tv with her. Recently he’s gotten back in his feet and has moved into his own place. This is where the problems have started. Since him moving out we have to “pick up his upstairs time”. My wife reminded her grandma of our agreement upon move in of the two nights a week upstairs visiting and dinner. Lately her grandma has become extremely passive aggressive towards me and my wife about our hobby and that it’s an extreme waste of time. Now her grandma is saying she’s going to her lawyer and is going to sell the house so she can go back to her home town 2 hours away from where she’s at now and live in a retirement home because we don’t spend enough time with her. We aren’t the only relatives around. My wife is one of four siblings and her dad, who all visit her once a week and her dad spends three nights a week. While my father in law has a sibling who live in the same town as us and visits once a month if that. The other two brothers live out of state and have proven that they don’t care about their mother. We pay her grandma rent every month and whether we order out or cook dinner we ask if she would like some or leave a helping of it in her fridge for her to eat later.

We went out to watch a band play, had a good time, and grabbed some food on the way back. My bf knows that I’m particular about the bed, and I almost always change his bedsheets when I come over, because he rarely changes them.
Well last night, when I was going to change the bed, he wouldn’t let me. He had a dirty, ripped up fitted sheet that wasn’t even stretched over the entire mattress leaving half of it bare, and the side that was covered was full of big holes revealing the dirty mattress underneath. I told him there was no way I was sleeping in a bed like that and asked him to let me fix it. It would have taken me 3 minutes, and he didn’t have to do anything. He said the bed was fine; turned out the lights and hopped in. I continued to beg him to let me put fresh sheets on and threatened to drive home but he said I was being ridiculous. I asked if I could get a blanket to lie on the couch and he threw a dirty stained mattress cover at me and said “use this”. So I left and drove all the way home, at 2 am. We had planned to go to his family’s the next morning, but I told him as I was leaving that I wasn’t driving all the way back. The next morning he was calling me asking why I wasn’t at his family’s as planned. I told him I wasn’t driving all the way back after having to drive home last night.

DefythePatriarchy,WIBTA for not turning my location services back on after a fight with my mom,2024-11-19T00:36:29.034000+0000,39,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gukf3j/wibta_for_not_turning_my_location_services_back/,"A little background- We have had Life360 on our phones for years, since my mom was a single mom and my brother and I got home from school before she did. It's never been a problem, because she checks it for peace of mind, knowing where her kids are. Now, she lives across the country with my brother, and I am in a different state. She has a brain injury and still looks at my location a lot, since I'm not great at answering texts all the time. My mom is in her 50s, I am 25, my brother is 23.
Last Christmas, I turned off my Life360 because I was going on a trip to Puerto Rico that I knew she wouldn't approve of. I lied about it when my brother asked why it was turned off, my mom caught me in the lie, and it blew up our relationship pretty badly because she felt like she couldn't trust me. I am well aware that I was the asshole in that part of the situation. I shouldn't have turned it off, and I definitely shouldn't have lied.
HOWEVER, nearly a year has passed, our relationship is still very rocky, and recently we are on the outs about my upcoming marriage. She doesn't approve and doesn't want it to happen, but I'm still doing it. She has started using my location against me- calling and starting fights whenever I spend time with my soon-to-be in-laws, asking why I'm leaving the house in the evenings, or what my plans are on the weekend that require me to drive an hour away from home. About two weeks ago, she and my brother turned off their locations and told me they were going to walk into the desert and unaliving themselves. I panicked, called the cops, and it turns out it was all a cry for help. They were sitting at home, totally fine. Well, I turned off my location out of anger and frustration. The thinking was, if they were going to turn theirs off to lie to me, then they didn't need to know my every move anymore.
My brother texted me a couple days ago, asking me to please turn my location back on so they can know when I'm home. I am reluctant, because I am still angry and hurt by their words and actions, and it has honestly been pretty freeing to know that my mom can't sabotage my days out by calling and starting fights when I leave the house. I know that she does look at my location for peace of mind (remember, brain injury- very emotional, very anxious). I also feel that at 25, in a different state, I should have a certain level of privacy from my mom. She does not need to know my every move. But I did turn it off once before, and that ended up causing a huge pile of mistrust and lies, and I don't want to do that again either. So would I be the asshole if I keep it turned off? Or should I do what they want and turn it back on?",,t3_1gukf3j,AITA
ConnectionFar2456,WIBTA for not accepting an apology after being uninvited from an event? ,2024-11-18T23:53:29.980000+0000,34,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gujh22/wibta_for_not_accepting_an_apology_after_being/,"Keinemusik is playing in London in June at Gunnersbury Park. My girlfriend, Tina, is a fan and asked if I wanted to go. I said yes. She also FaceTimed her sister Yasmin to confirm she was attending. Yasmin is bringing her boyfriend Jim, and Tina’s friend Yvonne is also coming. Yasmin asked Tina to buy tickets.
During the call, Tina joked about buying four tickets but not confirming who they were for. She said, “OP and I are going, Yvonne is going—I’m not sure who the fourth ticket is for.” Over the next few days, Tina repeatedly asked me if I was sure I wanted to go. Each time, I confirmed that I did, as I enjoy their music (even if I’m not as big of a fan as Tina or her friends). I’ve been intrigued by the hype, and events like this are something Tina and I typically do together.
Today, however, her tone shifted. Tina said Yasmin had shown her a new set she thought I might not like. I reassured her I did like their music and asked if she was trying to get me to say I didn’t want to go. To my surprise, Tina admitted she’d been thinking it over and decided she’d like to make it a girls’ night with Yvonne, as they rarely get the chance to do things like this together.
I asked if Yasmin and Jim were still going, which Tina confirmed but said, “I’m not going with them—I don’t think I’ll see much of them.” I felt rejected. Instead of an open and loving conversation, it felt like she drip-fed me hints to manipulate me into not going. She could’ve said, “I’d like this to be a girls’ night—would you mind inviting a friend?” Instead, it felt calculated, and that she didn’t want me there.
What makes it harder is picturing Tina, Yvonne, Yasmin, and Jim having fun without me— and not only not missing me but actively having arranged for me not to be there. I actually did what Tina suggested earlier and listened to their latest set to make sure I would like it, only to be hurt more when I was temporarily made to be even more excited for the event only to then realise I had to find someone who actually wanted to go with me. I also sort of don’t want to go on my own or with anyone else because I feel like I’ll be in my head about whether Tina is having more fun without me and it’ll ruin the experience.
Tina has since apologised for the way she handled it and admitted that she should have just been honest and direct, but something still isn’t sitting right with me about essentially being excluded from this event. She did say in passing that perhaps I should invite two other friends (a couple, interestingly enough she assumed they would come as an item even though we seemingly do not) and go with them, but her not wanting to spend this time with me is hurting. We do have other plans lined up—a trip in December and another event in June 2025—so this isn’t a pattern of exclusion. Still, I can’t shake the hurt, especially since I’m used to us doing things like this together.

Little-Intention2210,AITA for refusing to switch seats with my (25F) brothers (27M) girlfriend?,2024-11-18T08:31:41.077000+0000,565,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gu0a5r/aita_for_refusing_to_switch_seats_with_my_25f/,"Ok, so bear with me, it’s my first time posting here and English is not my native language, I’ll try to include all the important information but please excuse any mistakes.
First, some context that I think it’s important. I (25F) moved recently to a new country really really far from home, with a new language and everything. I know nearly no one here except for my brother (27M), he’s been away for almost 10 year and we’ve only seen each other maybe 4 times since he left. He now lives 4 hours away from where I’m currently staying and I try to visit him once a month for a weekend. He has a girlfriend (26F who I’ll refer from now on as SIL), they’ve been together for a little bit more than a year and live together. I haven’t had any issues with her but I’ve noticed that she is kind of jealous?? (She once got really angry with my brother because he accidentally called me sweetheart, which is how he usually refers to her), I don’t know but I think this is important later.
Now, to the actual situation. I visited this past weekend, and there was this event my brother wanted to take me. 5 tickets were needed, for my brother, me, SIL, and two friends of SIL, my brother got 2 tickets as a gift from his boss, so only 3 tickets were needed to be bought, but when he tried to buy them next to the gifted tickets there was no place so SIL friends bought 3 tickets in another zone, supposedly a better zone than the gifted tickets(the places where numbered). When I spoke with my brother about the seating arrangement he said that we would figure it out but that we (he and I) would be seating together, since the 2 strangers were SIL friends. That was really important for me since I’m not very social and even less in this new language, and also I travel to visit my brother so that’s the only person I care to spend time with.
The day before the event my brother tells me that I’ll have to sit with SIL friends because SIL wants to sit with him. I proposed different solutions (changing the tickets with SIL friends for example) but the only option that would leave SIL satisfied was she sitting with my brother alone and me being seated with these two strangers I know nothing about. This turned into a hugeeeee argument between all of us because my brother wanted to do what SIL wanted to avoid fighting with her, but I stood on my ground and told him that if that was the sitting arrangement then I preferred staying at home while they went to the event (which is true). Eventually he got her to accept and I ended up being seated with my brother while SIL seated with her friends, but now she is angry at me. Was I the asshole? This is really bothering me because I’ve only been around for a short time and this already happened with her and I want to have a good relationship with my brother, specially since he is my only family here.",,t3_1gu0a5r,AITA

It was crowded, but I was lucky enough to get a 2 person table with an outlet. I stayed there for maybe three hours and ordered multiple items throughout my stay.
About an hour into my stay, a girl about my age who reeked of weed asked if she could share my table so she could study as well. I looked around and every other chair was occupied and there were even people standing beside the tables. I absolutely despise the smell of weed. It’s legal in my state so there’s no issues there, but it makes me nauseous and gives me a headache, so I knew there was no way I would get anything done with that girl across from me. Without mentioning her smell, I told her no and that I needed my personal space.
Instead of walking away, she pressed and said that if I wanted my personal space I shouldn’t study in the most popular coffee shop in town. I then told her that I specifically didn’t want her at my table because she smelled like a marijuana farm and she should take a shower before she tries to infringe on strangers’ personal space. I thought she would go away after that, but she told me she was sitting at my table whether I liked it or not. She put her things down, maybe thinking I would leave.
Instead, I flagged down an employee and explained the situation. She sided with me and asked the girl to leave, threatening to call security if she didn’t do so.
I resumed my work but felt a bit shaken by the situation. Later that evening, I recalled what happened to some of my friends. I thought that they would all agree that she was being an AH, but to my surprise, a couple of my friends told me I was the unreasonable one. One of them is familiar with the coffee shop and told me that it was rude of me to hog a table (even though I bought two drinks and a pastry throughout my stay), and that if I really had a problem with someone smelling bad, I should have just left. Another one of my friends said that my comment about how that person smelled was out of line, and even if someone is being rude I shouldn’t talk like that to a stranger. This sparked a huge debate until I agreed to post on this sub to settle this once and for all. So, am I TA in this situation?",,t3_1gtmbjd,AITA

I average 80–90 hours of work and school weekly. My roommate, 27, is a cancer survivor with some disabilities. That said though he works 40–50 hours a week in the trades and his disability is definitely a thing, but it's not so debilitating that he needs to be dependent on others at this point.
We’ve lived together for a few years, and his ex used to handle nearly all his household tasks. While that was understandable during his recovery, he’s fully independent now. Two months ago, we moved into a new place, just the two of us. Since then, he hasn’t washed any dishes, doesn’t put them away when I clean em, and often leaves his laundry in the machine for days until I remind him. He overfills the trash, and I’m usually the one who ends up taking it out. He claims he ""doesn’t use dishes like that"" when I asked if he could have the next load, even though he definitely still does generate some (admittedly less than I do because I eat a more varied diet and do some cooking). If it's the workweek, he's flatly told me he won't do chores. Thing is, on the weekends he's still not doing any choring and spends most of his time in bed sleeping.
He doesn’t have a car and has been borrowing mine. While he doesn’t overuse it, he’s never put gas in it, and I’ve recently put my foot down on him using it. His financial habits add to my frustration—despite earning ~$18/hour, he spends excessively on high-end items like a $1,000 Dyson vacuum, multiple flagship phones, expensive clothes, $1000+ on tech he doesn't use, $500 chess board despite not liking chess, $1800 computer chair he doesn't use, and recently financed $8,000–$9,000 in bedroom furniture, yet hasn’t saved for a car. Meanwhile, I’ve been rebuilding my life from near-homelessness over the past three years, living modestly and prioritizing essentials.
I feel like I’m carrying the majority of household responsibilities. I suspect he'd justify it by saying he contributed a lot of money on mutual household essentials and that's how he feels he is contributing, but I could’ve gone on FB marketplace or thrifted those for much less... plus it doesn't negate the expense I've put towards things for the house. His insistence on high-end items reflects his personal standards, and I'm feeling like I'm not being heard when I ask him to help. I want a functional, clean home, not an extravagant one, and I’m tired of coming home from 8hrs of work, with 8hrs+ of school waiting for me, and having to take an intermission to tidy up the place. I'm only averaging like 4hrs of sleep a night because of how thin I'm spread and I don't feel like he respects what I'm doing.
Would I be wrong to stop stepping in and let his responsibilities pile up? He’s been vaguely upset about not being able to borrow my car, and his refusal to contribute more is making me second-guess myself on if I'm in the wrong here.",,t3_1gug6q7,AITA
Han-een,AITA for not returning a gift my ex friend gave me? ,2024-11-18T16:50:34.466000+0000,84,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gu99h4/aita_for_not_returning_a_gift_my_ex_friend_gave_me/,"Last year I moved into a new apartment, it was unfurnished. I went to my friend’s house right after receiving my keys to celebrate. During our conversation she mentions her extra couch and tv in her garage and that she would like me to have it, I insisted that I dont take it and that it was too much. However she insisted right back that I take it, and after a few minutes of a back and forth I finally agreed (wish I didnt)
Next day comes round, the moving guy helps load the couch and tv into his van and we drive back to my new place and unload it there. I thanked her for giving me the furniture. A few months passed by and me and this friend got into an altercation, and our friendship ended there.
Few more months pass by, and 2 days ago she sends a mutual friend between us to speak on her behalf, her message consisted of her telling me that the moving truck will be here in a few hours, and that I have to give her back the couch and tv, or pay her for it. (Mind you Ive had the furniture for over a year now)
I told her no, I will not be giving her the furniture or paying her back, because it was a gift. And I’m not obligated to return to her now that she’s angry at me from our previous altercation before summer started. The altercation itself that happened was because I genuinely needed to cut her off for my own safety, I had many reasons as well as her being disrespectful towards me and the people I love.
Her reaction after I told her that I wouldn’t be giving her the furniture back was to threaten me with calling the police. Which is like…Im not sure what they can do about that lol, but probably nothing. What bothers me now is that shes sending so many people to talk to me on her behalf, Ive been getting calls from “no caller id” numbers and they’re accusing me of stealing the furniture. Im not sure how I would carry a couch and tv on my back and go unnoticed but oh well.
What worries me is that our friends that we have in common probably heard from her that I “stole her stuff” and I dont really want to go up to each one of them and explain myself. I really dislike how the people she sent are urging me to return her stuff so she could stop bothering me, however this is my dilemma…this person disrespected me, started rumors about me, and threatened me…wouldn’t I be “weak” or “submitting” by returning a gift that she gave to me over a year ago? But also if I didnt, I dont know to what more lengths she’s willing to go.
Personally, I don’t view the furniture as hers because Ive had it for over a year. And if she had asked me for money back then I would have given it to her. I think its unfair she’s demanding I return the stuff or pay her, a year later. On the other hand I do feel guilty. What are your thoughts? What type of action should I take?",,t3_1gu99h4,AITA

We connected quickly and things got very sexual between us then we got into a relationship quickly, like very quickly.
At first everything seemed normal, but then she started getting possessive, like really possessive. It was to a level where I'd be accused of cheating if a girl stopped me in the street to ask for directions or sit next to me on the bus. I'm not exaggerating it happened.
For nearly 1.5 years i was putting up with it and reassuring her always and providing proof of my loyalty. But then after that i started getting extremely tired and fed up. It's gotten to a point where i LIE because of it.
She accused me of fucking a coworker, a professor, some old friends which i cut off FOR HER. and guess what, even my female cousins...
Recently i had an interview and i was interviewed by a woman and when i got home i told her that i was interviewed by a man so that she doesn't throw all her accusations at me again.
I'm overall not liking the person I'm becoming with her, i can't tell her anything without it being a problem. There's so much more to it but i don't want this post to be 10 pages long lmao.
So only focusing on this certain problem and me lying to her recently. Am i the asshole?",,t3_1guk2r8,AITA
Pleasant-Cupcake-517,AITA for cancelling someone’s return pickups?,2024-11-18T06:04:33.055000+0000,489,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gty8jo/aita_for_cancelling_someones_return_pickups/,"My husband (35M) works for a popular clothing company that has a shopping app. He gets employee discounts on purchases via to app. Now he has given his login credentials to a few of his close friends to take advantage of his employee discounts which is of no issue to me. However, these friends have gone ahead and shared the login credentials with their own friends and families who use the app constantly and have on many occasions used up the discounts (there is a limit on the amount of discounts you can utilise per quarter or so). Now comes the issue - some random person whom I do not know has gone ahead and placed orders for himself but has chosen my address and contact by mistake (it was listed as one of the addresses on the app but I have now deleted it). This said person did not contact either me or my husband to apologise for the mistake and neither have they cancelled the orders in time before they were packed. This app is a real pain because all orders are shipped separately and you receive a security password via SMS that you have to give to the delivery agent even if you are returning the package. A little background about my situation - I work from home and have a baby who naps in the afternoons and I also have a dog… can you see where I’m going here? It’s a hassle every-time the door rings coz my dogs goes ballistic barking and the baby wakes up. The parcels for this app are almost exclusively delivered in the afternoons. In order to ensure my baby is not woken up, I have to ensure that when I know the delivery agent has entered my housing colony, i lock my dog up in a bedroom and wait by the door so he doesn’t ring the doorbell. I also often times have meetings during this time of day. I personally have stopped ordering from this site because of this issue. I’m really miffed that the person who placed the order did not have the courtesy to give us a heads up about the mistake or to apologise. He has also gone ahead and raised requests for the packages to be picked up without requesting us! This would again incur the whole song and dance of me locking up my dog and waiting by the door during the work day which would total 6 times coz it’s 3 separate packages (2 of which have been delivered already and were due to be picked up) and one on the way. I hence went ahead and cancelled the return pickups. This will lead to the person not getting their amounts refunded. I have decided to refuse the third and final packGe for which he will get his money back. My husband says I’m an AH because his friend has now reached out to him saying it was his brother (from another town) who mistakenly placed the orders, and that I should not create such a fuss about the matter. Am I the AH here?
An update - I figured why I don’t have the password - turns out neither does my husband. This has gone so way out of control that the friend (whose brother it was who ordered the packages to my address by mistake) is the one with the original login credentials! All he needed was my husband’s email address and has used his own mobile number to register. My husband doesn’t even have access to this app coz he’ll require a PIN that will be sent to his friend’s mobile number! 🙄 my husband is in the process of changing jobs and I’ve warned him against sharing such info with “friends” or anyone for that matter.
Update 2 - I had a word with the husband and he has cancelled his account. Thank you everyone for your responses. My husband agrees that he should not be sharing his login credentials with anyone no matter what the reason could be.",,t3_1gty8jo,AITA
Satan-PostRehab,AITA for teaching my daughter the importance of sleep?,2024-11-17T16:47:50.951000+0000,6310,867,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gthqwt/aita_for_teaching_my_daughter_the_importance_of/,"Just like any other kid, my (7 yo) daughter HATES bedtime. If it’s ever 9:59 and we tell her it’s bed time then she will make a huge court case about how we are depriving her of one minute of her life.
I always let it go but this week when I told her it’s bed time at 10:05 she protested.
Essentially she didn’t understand why she had to go to bed while the rest of us adults stayed up later. It’s unfair that we get to enjoy the rest of our night while she has to go to bed early.
I mean she’s not wrong, it definitely makes more sense for me to go to bed early as well since all of us wake up roughly around the same time but I needed her to understand the consequence of the trade off between sleep and early mornings.
So I told her okay…she can stay up as long as she wants. Hell, if we go to bed she can keep watching tv all night till the next morning.
Her eyes glimmered and she did her little victory dance before sitting on the sofa and enjoying her little win. My wife protested saying that she’ll be too tired for school tomorrow and I said “that’s the point”.
I went to bed and woke up at 7am, sure enough my daughter slept on the sofa probably about 2 hours before I woke up. Understandably, getting her to wake up and get ready for school was a battle that neither of us enjoyed. I dropped her off at school and picked her up again after work, she was DONE with the day and slept in the car on the way home.
Once we got home she tried to go to bed and I told her she can’t because her swimming lesson is in an hour so she needs to get ready for that.
She cried but I still forced her to go with her mom.
She came back just barely able to make it through the day and tried making her way up the stairs again. I told her she forgot about her homework and she started crying again.
My wife said we should let her sleep but I was firm on my stance that if we let her off the hook right now then she will never understand the consequences of her decision. Delaying responsibilities due to factors within your control isn’t okay and I don’t want her learning that it is.
I helped her with her homework and by the time it was 8 she was already in bed.
The next night when it was 10 she didn’t even protest, just started walking up to her bedroom and declined when I asked her if she wanted to stay up with us.
I thought the mission was a success but my wife questioned my parenting technique and said it was border line neglectful & manipulative.
I disagreed but after a few conversations with friends and family I’m slowly starting to doubt myself…so reddit AITA?
Edit: To all the people dming me about almost killing my daughter by sending her to a 2ft pool with a swimming instructor…where the hell do you get this false confidence from when running with these false narratives?",,t3_1gthqwt,AITA

My wife works in the medical field and is often unable to answer her phone due to being with patients. I work from home and am pretty much reachable at every moment unless I'm on a call, but even then I can call back right away. So we had put me as the primary contact person and my wife as secondary, and even informed the school's office manager of our situation so that I could be made the primary contact.
They have had to call us a few times this school year and each time, they call my wife (leaving a message, because again, she can't answer most of the time) and then...they don't even call me at all. I only find out what's going on once my wife is able to check her phone and relay the message. The last time this happened we reminded the school of the situation and they told us that they usually just call the mother because ""the mom is usually the easiest to get ahold of"" totally disregarding our repeated reminders of our situation and me being made the primary contact person.
Today, our youngest got hurt during recess and, yet again...they called herm left a message and didn't call me. And yet again I only found out an hour later once my wife relayed the message. I have no idea what else to do at this point and it's pretty irritating.",,t3_1guetv7,text

For context, I knew my friend’s gf longer than my girlfriend and we developed a friendship over the years so she texts/snaps me once in a while but not often. Also, my friend has no problem with this and he knows there is no funny business between her and I. My girlfriend however, was furious that she texted me asking about my parents. She said it was not her business and I needed to respond with something like “why are you asking about my parents” or “that’s not really any of your concern” which I think is incredibly rude especially to my friend’s gf. I understand that my girlfriend doesn’t love the idea of her and I having private messages, but it was only about 5 back and forth texts (me explaining to her why my parents were in her town) and I showed her the entire conversation to ease her doubts. Then my girlfriend found out that I have been wishing my friend’s gf happy birthday for the last few years and got so mad she basically broke up with me. I am so frustrated and confused. Is this not an okay thing to do when I have a girlfriend? I know it’s another girl but it’s my best friend’s girlfriend, not just a rando and we have been friends for years and I don’t want to burn bridges.

She has organized her own birthday parties, excelled at debate team and the Feminist Roundtable club at her school where she organized a fundraiser for at-risk young women… I’m beyond proud of her. She is an incredible person and I truly feel the sky is the limit for her.
However, she has recently made a friend group who I believe is not great for her. Three people, two are non-binary and one girl, and all of them claim to be autistic. I guess this has rubbed off on my daughter because now she is also claiming to be autistic. My sister is following her on TikTok and I guess she posts “stimming” videos and other things. She has given me zero evidence before this point to even entertain the notion that she is autistic. I truly never even considered it until she met these friends. This leads me to believe it is made up.
I have noticed that these friends are causing her to distance herself from her other friends that encouraged a more healthy lifestyle - friends she met in feminist roundtable for example who I really liked. She does not really do anything anymore but sit in her room and make videos with these friends about autism. It’s really strange and has me feeling pretty bad.
The other day her and her friends were in the kitchen and my daughter said something along the lines of “she wouldn’t understand because she isn’t autistic” about a classmate. I calmly stated after she said this that she is not autistic either, has self diagnosed, and shouldn’t patronize people by claiming that she is autistic as it is inappropriate to people who actually struggle. She got furious and stomped up to her room. Her friends followed. She’s not talking to me anymore.

We're having our last group projects before our finals.
Context: My school does this project every year with the 10th, 11th and 12th grades, where we have a theme to follow and have to film either a music video, a documentary or a short film. Since I'm a senior this year, we got the short film.
What happened was, I was supposed to do the filming. We were seven people, each in charge of something. Comes the day to write the script and the guy who's supposed to do it doesn't know how. Who ends up doing it? Me. And this pattern only repeats, up until the point where I've done the script, filming, directing, editing, compiling the soundtrack, etc. So I basically did the whole thing by myself. While I was editing, we were supposed to make a poster for the movie, so it could be displayed. I told my group several times through message that someone should start the poster, so we will have time to print it. Comes the day before we're supposed to turn it in, and who did it? No one. And when I ask, suddenly nobody knows how to use Canva. So I do it.
I was very overwhelmed during this project, but still didn't want anyone to have their grade lowered for not helping, so I didn't make a formal complaint to my project coordinator, only commented with him that my group wasn't very helpful.
Now for the issue: We have another group project (smaller this time) about the other project (like a recap thing), and we were going to be the same group. We decide we're just going to speak about our experience to the class. We have to present tomorrow. Suddenly these 2 girls decide they don't want to do that. They want to do a kahoot for the class. But they sent the message saying that at 2 pm today. I only got home about 2 hours ago (so about 7:30pm), and I have 2 other group projects and a solo one to work on. So I forgot to respond. About an hour ago, my phone dings, and it's a big paragraph in our groupchat, of this one girl saying that because only her a her friend did this, they're taking it for themselves. That would be fine by me, if she hadn't written ""we think it's fair, since some people didn't respond to our message"". Then I got really pissed off, cause I knew it was directed at me. So I answered ""look, idrc if yall do it alone, but if I had taken this same action during the main project, half of the group wouldn't even have a grade"". This girl went on to answer with some bs, like ""oh but i always answered the messages"", and I was like ""no?? during the making of the poster i was literally speaking to myself in the chat where were you??"" And I have screenshots of that, that I can use as proof.
So now I'm thinking of going to my project coordinator and asking that he changes their grades, so it's fair. He's already aware that I did the whole thing by myself, so I'm confident I can make it happen. WIBTA if I get the teacher to lower their scores? I really don't wanna be an asshole but I'm so angry, and feel it's justified.",,t3_1gul5l2,AITA

We were hanging out with a good friend of mine (her name is Rachel) that I’ve known for almost 20 yrs and my GF has known for 4 years at this point. We finished playing a game on Rachel’s switch and Rachel asked my GF, Sarah, if she wanted to try Stardew Valley. Sarah said “sure!”
I dislike Stardew Valley, I’ve tried to play multiple times. I think it’s dumb. So while they were playing, I sat on my phone and read med publications like I like to do in my downtime.
While playing, Sarah kept saying “ahhh I have no idea what I’m doing. I’m not sure what to do! Ahhh don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing!” In a very playful, joking voice while laughing but continued playing.
During this time, Sarah asked me 3-4 times if I wanted to play. Every single time, I responded with ‘no. I don’t like Stardew valley.’ ‘No, I don’t like to play.’ ‘No, I’m good but thanks.’
45 mins pass and I started getting tired so I said ‘I’m tired, are you ready to head out?’ Sarah gets up and we leave.
We get in the car and Sarah goes “finally, I was trying to hint at you the entire time, I didn’t want to play.” I said what hint? You were laughing, joking, kept playing, and asked if I wanted to play.
I said why didn’t you just… say you didn’t want to play? Or put the controller down or ask to play something else…? Sarah says “I tried!” Ok… you tried but you kept playing? That sends a mixed message… that you want to play.
Then Sarah said it was ‘awkward’ because Rachel is my friend and I should have been the one to tell Rachel that Sarah didn’t want to play Stardew Valley.
I told Sarah she’s an adult with her own autonomy. She can tell people whether or not she wants to play a video game. Just like how I said no, I wasn’t interested several times and refused to play. I said I’m not a parent who’s going to guess these weird in between the lines communications. I told Sarah if she didn’t want to play or wanted to leave, all she’d have to do is state those things.

Adventurous_Agent795,AITA for asking my sister for money ,2024-11-18T23:31:06.829000+0000,15,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1guiywq/aita_for_asking_my_sister_for_money/,"Two weeks ago I (F16) was at a friends birthday party and my sister (F19) was meant to pick me up. When it came to the end of the birthday party I messaged her to pick me up but she didn’t respond. I assumed its because she didn’t want to pick me up as we were arguing over this earlier and she kept saying I should take a taxi and only agreed when in the car to pick me up. So I paid for a taxi home (£20) but when I got home she was asleep and I don’t have a key so I couldn’t open the door. I banged on the door until my phone got to 5% and then I just got a taxi to my friends house (£30).
For context , My mum was out at a sleepover with her friend and she was really excited about it so I didn’t want to call her as I know she would stress out and wouldn’t be able to help much as she can’t drive and was an hour away. It would also get my sister into more trouble as she recently got introuble for debt related stuff which has been stressful as the whole house has been tense and arguing. My sister woke up in the morning and picked me up at the time I didn’t ask her to pay me back because I was exhausted and stressed.
However today I had my form for my provisional liscense on the table and she ripped it open with the excuse that she thought it was her letter, which makes no sense as it didn’t have her name on it or our address. I now have to pay £34 again to get a new form. The issue is the money I used in these two scenarioa was money my mum had given me to get my diabetes medication at the end of the month ( we use a private online healthcare provider). So I asked my sister if she could give me £45 to help me recover the money lost as I need to pay for the medication in a week and I know my mum won’t be able to afford to give me another £100 on such short notice. However she refused and said it wasn’t her responsibility as she made reasonable mistakes and that I am trying to bully and manipulate her.",,t3_1guiywq,AITA

italianCloser,WIBTA if I quit being a scoutmaster for a troop after only being in the role for 6 months? ,2024-11-18T19:19:58.472000+0000,30,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1guczll/wibta_if_i_quit_being_a_scoutmaster_for_a_troop/,"For the past two years, I’ve been involved in Scouting through my kids. I originally stepped up as an Assistant Scoutmaster to help out when our Scoutmaster needed support. About a year ago, he asked if I’d be interested in taking over as Scoutmaster, as he was ready to step back after his kids aged out of the program nearly a decade ago.
At the time, I wasn’t fully aware of the time commitment required of a Scoutmaster. As an Assistant Scoutmaster, I’d been fairly insulated from the administrative side, so I didn’t fully grasp the demands of the role.
Let me share some personal context. My wife is an executive for a Fortune 100 company and travels extensively, often Monday through Friday. We have three children: a 21-year-old in college, and two younger kids, ages 14 and 12, who are still at home and need our attention. My career is demanding, and lately, I’ve felt overwhelmed trying to balance everything. During August and September, I was gone almost every weekend for scouting events, and my wife and I barely saw each other. The strain this has put on our marriage and family dynamic is undeniable.
On top of this, the role itself has become increasingly difficult to manage. Our troop shares a committee with another larger troop, and there’s frequent friction over responsibilities. In practice, many tasks—purchasing supplies, coordinating merit badges and rank advancements, scheduling outings, and even managing payments—have fallen solely on me. This isn’t sustainable.
Recently, tensions within the troop have escalated. There’s been infighting among Assistant Scoutmasters, which even led to a shouting match I had to break up during a meeting. Some parents refuse to read communications, then blame me for a lack of information. Others overstep boundaries to the point of violating youth protection guidelines, an issue I’ve escalated to both the committee and council without resolution.
I’ve reached a breaking point. The constant demands of scouting, combined with my career and family responsibilities, have left me no time to focus on my own mental health and well-being. My wife put it best: the moment volunteering stops being personally rewarding is the moment to step away. For me, that moment has arrived.
With the holiday season approaching and no major events planned until February, I feel this is an appropriate time to resign. The troop has about 30 Scouts, and we’re linked with another troop of 80 Scouts, so there are plenty of Assistant Scoutmasters, registered adults, and committee members who can step up.
While I’ve valued my time as Scoutmaster and the memories I’ve created, I can’t continue in a role that is affecting my mental health, my marriage, and my ability to be present for my children. I hope the troop understands my decision, and I believe my stepping away will open the door for someone else who is better positioned to take on this responsibility.

I usually let it go but recently she was putting down her husband in front of me and a few others and I just snapped, basically telling her that she should be grateful to have a husbabd who does so much for her and her daughter (not his child).
I might have even said that at family events when she talks down to him I see the light in his eyes go out. I've never really spoken like this to her before but I was just so frustrated, particularly as someone who is divorced and in the horrid app dating scene. I was trying to get her to appreciate what she has but I guess I also don't know the whole story of their relationship behind closed doors.
Her response to my comments was that she deserves to be treated like a queen, and I thought sure but does that mean degrading your partner in front of others?",,t3_1gu1unq,AITA

Funny, brilliant, intelligent... and vegan (so no meat, no fish, no cheese...) ! On our third date, he brought it up and explained his convictions, etc. About an hour later, we decided to order. He chose the vegetarian dish on the menu. I went for the burger (which, to be fair, was dripping with cheese).
From my perspective, he’s free to eat what he wants. But I have no intention of becoming vegan or even vegetarian myself. So, I simply ordered what I felt like eating at that moment.
A few days later, we talked again over text, and he called me out on it. For him, it was a real lack of tact on my part and pretty disrespectful of his convictions, which he had shared just an hour before we ordered.
Now I’m feeling a bit confused about the situation. I like him, but I don’t really see where the disrespect lies in my actions.
What’s your take on this? (Please don’t respond if you’re anti-vegan. This isn’t about criticizing him specifically, but rather about evaluating my own reaction during that dinner)
Thanks!
Edit : Just a clarification : of course he never asked me to become vegetarian myself one day. In this case, it’s the fact that I ate meat in front of him (right after he talked about it and considering we might potentially kiss afterward). I’ll add that, in the end, he did pay for both our meals.",,t3_1gto88f,AITA

We had lunch after, during which we discussed plans for a group to a museum with ourselves, my husband M(28) (her brother) and their other sister. We had discussed it in the past, but she was injured and we had to delay planning the trip until she received her results. She suggested a group chat to see if everyone would be able to go on 11/23. She had trouble typing due to her medications/injury, so she asked me to create the group chat. This is what I wrote: “Would you guys be available for 11/23 to go the museum? Stephanie (SIL) should be able to handle it by then.” I showed her the text before I sent and she approved it. Today my husband went to her house to help her with something. When he came back he mentioned that his sister was annoyed by the text I had sent, and she claimed that I overstated her commitment to the museum trip on that date. My husband, who was not aware that I had typed the message out in front of her with her approval, assumed there was a miscommunication due to English being my second language. He told me that when he mentioned that to her she was skeptical because I was born in English speaking country, and lived there for the first seven years of my life. He pointed out to her that I lived in a Spanish speaking household in a Hispanic community, before returning to my parents home country at the age of 7. She apparently remained skeptical and changed the subject. It’s also worth noting that during our lunch she had asked very probing questions about my immigration status and my family’s status. My husband says that he felt a sense of hostility from her towards me for my English skills, I felt somewhat discriminated against by her questions at lunch. This seems out of character because she very liberal when it comes to politics to anyone who will listen but my husband and I both felt a sense of hostility towards me.

So I agreed to recommend his work to some of my contacts, as soon as he prepares a portfolio that’s more fitting to the market’s demands.
He sent me some stuff he’s working on and I tried to give him some honest feedback. One of the things I said is that his work looks a bit derivative of Quentin Blake’s style (that’s the illustrator who worked in most of Roald Dahl’s book) and that he should keep practicing to showcase a more unique personality.
Despite telling my bf that this is part of the process - even mentioning that Tim Burton’s early illustrations were declined by publishers who found it too derivative of Dr Seuss -, he took the feedback very personally and I could tell he was a bit hurt.
I told him he must get used to it if he wants to build a career in this business, and if he likes his work as it is he can try to get his foot in the door through other means and maybe receive other opinions, but I will not be using my own network to recommend a professional that I don’t think is quite there.

The question seems silly, but is part of a broader issue and a bit of a sanity check. I am often in a headspace where I think ""maybe I am a completely unreasonable, narcissistic a** hole and don't even realize it.""
My gf and I work in tech. There have been times when there was a job or some advice I wanted from a professional, and she had a connection. She usually offers to connect me, then never follows through- even after several reminders. Sometimes it's because she is forgetful. Other times she is protective/nervous that my interaction will reflect poorly on her.
This past week, my partner asked if she could chat with the copywriter on my team for advice. My coworker was on board and sent her cell# to set up a call.
While my gf and I were on a walk, I asked if she chatted with my coworker. She said, ""We are supposed to talk today, but I accidentally signed up for Pilates. I need to tell her I can't today."" My partner is forgetful and can be flakey. I responded, ""Just make sure you give her a heads-up soon."" I can't remember her response, but the vibe was: I'm not a kid, I'll handle it. I too care about how my connections reflect on me. I have connected friends with people in the past and have had them flake. It doesn't feel good. Also, I respect that my coworkers are very busy.
Later on, I bring it up again, and things escalate:
Me: ""I just want to ask, if you are going to use my connection, please communicate about when you can talk and follow through.""
R: ""Why are you talking to me like I am 10? I know how to follow up. You already brought this up 3 times on our walk""
Me: ""You asked me to connect you. I am just asking that you respect me and follow through.""
R: ""I don't want to fight about this. It's not a big deal.""
Me: ""I know it's not, I am just making a request. You can just say 'okay.' My coworkers are busy. You have a history of being late or not communicating.""
R: ""When have I not followed through? When am I late?""
- We are the couple that either flakes last min or shows up 30m late. It's usually because she is trying to fit ALL the stuff in or thinks the event is not important enough to be on time or communicate. This is something we clash on- I value being on time and communicating with people if we are going to be late/flake. This can skew into some rigidity. After 3+ yrs of this, I have begun to throw it back to her as a character flaw, which is not fair- I am working on it.
Me: ""You are late to stuff a lot. I want to make sure you will follow up, S*** is a busy person.""
R: ""It's not a big deal, she's like 12."" (my coworker is in her 30s)
Me: ""Why are you so f'ing rude? You are so entitled.""
R: ""I have been working in this industry for 12 years, a lot longer than you. I don't need you to tell me how to be professional. Shut the door.""
That is how it ended. I could have done better. We have been having back a forths like this very frequently over the past few months, and my ability to regulate has severely dwindled. AITA?",,t3_1guelqj,AITA
Immediate-Primary-24,AITA for not taking out my roommates plastic recycling?,2024-11-19T01:43:54.104000+0000,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gultnw/aita_for_not_taking_out_my_roommates_plastic/,"So some backstory on this post,
Around 2 years ago, after moving in with my current roommate, I came home to find they'd emptied the drain rack and left my plastic recycling (that was drying in the rack) on the counter. When I asked about it, they said they thought we should be individually responsible for moving our plastic recycling to the bin outside. I said okay, and have been doing that ever since.
Our cardboard recycling is kept in front of a wall in the kitchen, maybe 4 feet from the drain rack, and our plastic recycling bin is outside the apartment. We take turns bringing the cardboard recycling from the wall and the plastic recycling BIN to the curb every week.
I typically move my plastic recycling from the counter before recycling day every week but have occasionally forgotten to, and they've left it on the counter when they took out the recycling. I never thought anything of it, because they said we were individually responsible for our plastic recycling.
It was my turn to take out the recycling today, so I moved my plastic recycling from the counter to the bin, took the bin to the curb, and then came back to grab the cardboard recycling and took that to the curb. I didn't take out the plastic recycling they had sitting under the cardboard against the wall, because, to me, that falls in the same realm of them saying they weren't responsible for my stuff on the counter (again, maybe 4 feet from the wall). That's what we have been doing for 2 years, so I just did what I was used to.
Hours later, they messaged me, mad that I didn't put their plastic recycling in the bin before I took it out. I presented them with the same logic I explained above, but they insisted that plastic recycling against the wall is different than on the counter, and that if I was taking my plastic from the counter to put in the bin I should have done theirs since it's on the way. I asked why that doesn't apply in reverse, and they said I usually have more recycling than them? Which I don't think is a fair argument.
This whole argument is dumb, but they insist I am at fault, and I'm still confused as to why. It feels like a double standard, a rule only applied to me.
I would love to know what an outside party thinks. Am I being crazy or is this a double standard?

In the passed five years however he has been here permanently because he needs a suitable environment for his son to be in during visitation which he cant provide.
When he returned the last time, a space separate from the the house was created for him because as we learned from the passed he is rather difficult to live with. HOWEVER he now regardless of having his own space spend most of his time in the house dominating our living space. He spends his time here leaves to his room and I am left to clean his dishes and anything he might leave behind because the house cleaning generally falls on me which I did not mind when it was my mum and I, as we both pull our weight. Beside this he has a very entitled attitude and is overall unpleasant to be around. He only sucks up when he needs something mainly cigarettes from me or money from my mum. I do not give him money anymore, I'm willing to work whatever job I need to unordered to gain experience and cover my personal expenses, he on the other hand feels many jobs are beneath him and will only consider a job if it pays R 15 000 or more ( has no qualifications ). He has no friends left as he has borrowed alot of money from them and never returned it. Everyone new he meets doesn't seem to stick around for long. Some of my own friends will not come over anymore because he has made them uncomfortable.
My mum always wants to see the best in him she gets fed up when she is around him to often. I however can see straight through his ""helpful or overly chatty friendly behavior"" and without a doubt he always asks for something. My mum provides everything gives him an allowance as well.
I from the age of 12 have lived pretty much without him, I became very used to our home dynamic with it being just me and my mum.

My(26M) girlfriend (22F) recently got pretty sick 2 days ago and has been down for the count sleeping most of the day. Her sister(26F) asked her to come over Sunday(today) to clean her house (like deep clean), not only that but her mom(54F) told her she should go do it cause money is tight and her sister would give them $100 + $50 to get it done all today. Not only told her to go but they don't have a car so she told her sick daughter to walk 30m to their house, now I know a 30m walk isn't horrible but it's 40f degrees out and windy.
So I took a break at work(Not hard, I work remote) to drive her the quick 5m over to their house. But the car ride was really uncomfortable cause I was upset and when she asked why I explained I really don't like that she is so willing to self sacrifice for others. She seem to understand where I'm coming from, she recently opened up and explained she got into a fight with her mom and said something along the lines of ""why do I only get to do what I want to do when I'm with him"" when her mom was asking her to spend more time with her after we started dating 2 months ago. So from a bf perspective it just feels like she knows she does too much for others but can't stop herself.
I've dated people like this before and it's caused some issues and I tried to be honest about that with her, that I'm not trying to come off rude or upset. It's just a sensitive thing for me, and has caused the ending of one of my past relationships.
Pretty much everyone in our social life I could talk to about this knows her family and has known them longer then me(Some of them avoid her mom/family 100%, and others are super close so everyone is bias). The only person I've even mentioned any of this to is my gf. So figured I'd ask here if I'm over reacting and need to just get used to this, even more so if I tend to date women who are empathetic and sympathetic?
*Edit sorry first time making one of these.
I think I might have been the asshole because of me getting upset and being distant in the conversation and from how my girlfriend reacted, because she got very quiet and just kept apologizing.
I don't think I was rude, but I only really gave brief answers cause I know if I get started talking while upset, what's on my mind will just come out. She was trying to make small talk on the short drive, and after she said sorry the 2nd time for me driving her, I decided to just explain I was upset and was upset cause I felt like since I've met her she 100% puts her mom, sister, dogs above her almost on the daily. She already is sick and I could hear it in her voice when she was trying to make conversation and after I said what I said she just said she was really sorry and thanked me again and then was quiet the last minute of the drive. I don't make eye contact with people if I'm upset so I didn't really look at her the whole drive. I do feel bad for my impulsive reactions but also feel like I know I have to put myself first and preach that or I'd end up in a worse situation.
In the past when I've tried to tell exs they're self sacrificing too much it's lead to arguments about me not caring enough or just disliking people and like I mentioned in one of my first serious relationships it's part of the reason we broke up.",,t3_1guippg,AITA

I am explaining this so you can understand this has always been a problem for me, and no matter how many times I've done it, its been a mess.
Whats going on: One of my childhood best friends got married last year and I was her MOH, when it came to the whole speech thing, although she preferred I do it, she had a Matron of Honor as well, her cousin, who offered to do the speech in my place. I helped with everything else, even had my twin toddlers be the flower girls, and it all worked out great. This upcoming summer, another childhood best friend is getting married and crowned me MOH, and I soon realized I would be in this position again very soon. Being at the wedding is one thing but being the MOH, doing everything and a speech, having my 3 kids there probably fussy etc, is a lot for me mentally and emotionally. She also wants my twins to be flower girls (they are 2), and my son (9) to be the ring bearer. All of this is a lot to handle, and my kids are shy! So when we went wedding shopping, the two of us went to lunch and despite me even being anxious to talk about it (I don't want to let her down), I explained how nervous I was for the wedding. I told her I didn't know if my son would be up for the challenge since he's very shy and doesn't know anyone at the wedding; that I will try my best with the twins but they are very unpredictable at this stage so we may want a plan B; and that I am terrified of a speech. No matter what I said, she ultimately said ""Oh stop, everything will be fine! You guys will do fine! I definitely want you all in the wedding and you to do a speech"". I backed down and just tried to enjoy the rest of the day, after all it was her dress day. I haven't brought it up since but every time I think about the wedding, I want to throw up. I know to some people this may seem selfish or irrational, but I cannot help it. I am currently working on a plan with my therapist to handle the day & speech, but I am dreading it every time it pops in my head. I just wish she would understand, she thinks I am being dramatic, or selfish I guess since it's her special day. I know I am the MOH and I don't mind trying to do most of the things, even all the bachelorette stuff, but it just seems like a lot for me, especially with the speech. Additionally, I know have this guilt that if I do it for this friend/bride, I should've done it for the other and worry about how she will feel.. AITA? :'(",,t3_1gulqft,AITA

No one in my house realized I was gone till almost 24 hours after I was already gone. My mom reported me as missing and stalked places I might be and harassed my friends to figure out where I was

Spiritual-Prior-7839,AITA for letting my parents stay over? ,2024-11-18T21:38:37.196000+0000,9,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gugc42/aita_for_letting_my_parents_stay_over/,"repost due to character limit
Alright so I'm a (22m) student in a big city that is notorious for stupidly high rent (think New York levels of stupid high rent) and I was being illegally kicked out of my home (long story) so I was searching for something new.
Unfortunately the search was not going well, and my landlord was becoming more belligerent and abusive so I needed to get out ASAP, so I talked to my girlfriend (22F) and asked her to help me look.
my girlfriend suggested that I move in with her grandparents, they have an entire 2 bedroom suite that they don't use that I could live in. obviously I took that offer and moved in. Her grandparents are retired and honestly extremely nice people and I'm very grateful that they allowed me to move in. Not only did they allow me to move in, but they charged me barely any rent (say 10% of what the place would actually be worth)
With this sweetheart deal in hand I asked my gf if maybe I could stay longer (conversations before hand implied that this was temporary) and she basically said that it was up to them.
anyways, about 2 months into my stay I'm in the kitchen cooking (we share a kitchen) and grandma (lets call her G) asks:
G: ""so whats up for the week? got any assignments coming up?""
me: ""not really, though my parents are coming down for this weekend so I think I'll probably have dinner with them or something""
G: ""oh that's terrific! where are they staying?""
me: ""not sure, some hotel downtown I think""
G: ""well, if they need a place to stay we have that bedroom in your suite they can use!""
me: ""wait really? they can stay here""
G: ""how long?""
me: ""just overnight, they have to be back home the next day""
G: ""oh absolutely! I'll make sure they have fresh towels for the shower""
me: ""wow, thank you!""
I remember this conversation so vividly because I have gone over it so so so many times in my head at this point. why? because 2 weeks later, well after my parents have left my girlfriend blows up on me, saying that I was taking advantage of her grandparents and not including her in decision making.
to be clear, her grandparents are all there, sure they're not the physical apex of humanity but they've been playing tennis weekly for the last 20 years and her grandma helped me with college level math, so they are not these senile, bed ridden old people or anything like that.
and she had over a week to voice her displeasure at the situation, when I asked her why she didn't say anything she pouted and said ""well you made the decision without me so I assumed I just wasn't considered"" and then was pissy after.
I'm just so confused because the visit was great, and they literally only used the place to sleep overnight and save on a (expensive) hotel, her grandparents loved my parents and everyone was super respectful of the space.
So now my gf has exploded and is saying that I need to get out ASAP, which I'm respecting and I'm looking at housing options.

This is not the first time that this has happened.
While at the bar he said that some drunk girl had asked him for his number and he had responded that he had a girlfriend but he still gave the number (for a friendship).
This same night he said that his friend was sick and stayed in my partners car and he went over to his friends car that was parked right beside his (a friend of the opposite sex) car to have a drink. Well long story short they all passed out and he fell asleep in the front seat of the car. He swears and says that nothing happened.
Well needless to say let’s just say that I went off on him that it was disrespectful of him to 1. Give that girl his number, that he’s more worried about being nice to other people than he is about hurting or upsetting me and that I essentially gave him an ultimatum to quit drinking and going out or that I’m done.
Some important info to know is that there is a trust issue and has been previous indiscretions.
So am I the asshole who owes him an apology or was i completely justified? How would you have reacted?
Updated to add that he says he passed out not from drinking too much bc he says he didn’t drink a lot but bc he was tired and fell asleep bc he got bored…",,t3_1gucpy5,AITA

For some background, she is the typical golden girl who always gets what she wants just cause she’s pretty (no matter how entitled or rude she behaves). I have always lived under her shadow, so there’s always been some weird rivalry between us.
My sister and her best friend (24M and my now fiancé) have known each other for a couple years and they quickly became close. I’ve always liked having him around because he made my sister a better person. For the first time, she seemed to really care about someone else besides herself. I always kept an eye on him to make sure he was being a good influence to my sister, but we never really talked to each other.
A couple years ago, we were introduced by a mutual friend (not my sister) and we started following each other on social media. We bonded over a movie, became friends, and eventually we started dating. Everyone could tell my sister was not happy about it (especially my fiancé) but I didn’t care; I knew this man was going to be the love of my life. She became really jealous that he was spending more time with me and giving me more attention and they started drifting apart until she eventually cut him off. She never displayed any sign of romantic interest and even denied it when asked (even before we started dating). I hate being the reason why they are no longer friends, but I don’t know how to make things better between them.

We are immigrants. It's only my parents my sister and my family in the country. My parents have gone back home as they just retired to take care of some business. My sister has been having a hard time with work and finding someone to watch her dog as she's going through some changes at work. She blames my parents for choosing their business back home instead of being here taking care of her dog in her time of need. she feels that she can't leave the dog anywhere else ( I have offered to take the dog but she doesn't want to part with him as I live far from home and our dogs don't get along) and that my parents are choosing their business over her happiness. I disagree with her and told her to get a dog sitter. She doesn't feel comfortable with getting one but because she doesn't have a choice she ended up getting one.
She complained to me that the dog sitter has been hitting on her and that she told him to stop but he's continuing and making her feel uncomfortable. She also mentioned he takes very good care of the dog and she wants to continue using his services. I told her it's a business so it just use him until my parents come back. She said it's not that simple I'm a man I don't understand her perspective. I found out she has given the guy her address before she knew he was interested in her. She also mentioned in this conversation that many guys are hitting on her because she's single and she feels uncomfortable and it's unfair to be a woman. I told her she shouldn't be giving out her address to people she meets through apps because as she mentioned the world is different for women and you have to protect your self. Even if the guy is wrong in what he's doing the one that is in danger is her so she should only give out phone number or only communicate through the app. She blew up saying I'm blaming the victim and that I always blame her. I feel that I am not blaming her but telling her how she can do things differently if she feels unsafe. AITH.
Tldr: my sister's dog sitter is hitting on her even though she told him no. she lives on her own and shes feeling uncomfortable and worried. I told her she should not be giving out her address to a dog-sitter she met on an app and said she should only communicate through the app. She should not put her self in dangerous situations. She thinks Im an asshole and am supporting the guy, it's okay to give out her address and the guy shouldn't be acting that way. I agree he shouldn't but we can't control that we can only control what we can do which is not give out your address! . She yelled at me and hung up saying I'm blaming the victim. AITH
Edit: when I say dog sitter I mean dog host. You have to drop off your dog at their place.

ThrowawayLoser23,WIBTA if I told an elderly man from my church I will not be shaking his hand?,2024-11-18T03:44:21.833000+0000,201,696,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gtvuyn/wibta_if_i_told_an_elderly_man_from_my_church_i/,"Hey, Internet.
If I'm TA here, I accept it. So, where I (26M) currently go to church, there's this elderly man, I'll call W (Probably in his 80s, or older). He sits in the foyer, because I think presumably, he finds it difficult to walk to the auditorium, and he has a clear view of the entrance door when he sits.
To cut to the chase, W is the kind to always call peoples' names excitedly and wants to shake hands, and he has a habit of grabbing one's hand with both of his when people do shake hands with him. And sometimes, he'll pull them in for a hug. He tends to call me ""Brother OP"" OP's Not my actual name, but I guess it's an elderly church thing among men to call ""Brother"".
He makes me uncomfortable, as I do not feel he respects my boundaries. I am not one to shake hands at all, and I usually wait for people to offer it to me, and meeting people does make me a bit uncomfortable, but no one else really pulls me in for a hug (except for him) unless I'm really good friends with the person. It just takes a long while for me to get used to a person.
In W's case, I've tried to just give fist bumps, but he insists I shake his hand. I've had to fake sickness and coughing just to avoid it, which he accepts (with visible disappointment). If I don't fake sickness he'll keep on insisting I shake his hand to the point of annoyance.
I did talk to my younger brother about it (since he also puts up with him and is also a bit uncomfortable with hugging or people like W), and he told me that I should just let it go because W is old, and he's probably lonely, etc. I always just thought that since I'm my own person, I have my own autonomy and it's my choice to hug or shake hands, etc. And no one has a right to me doing that, regardless of age.
I'm really close to saying, ""Well if you don't want a fist bump for me, then bye. Have a good day"". Then leaving. Or simply leaving and ignoring him. Or try to see if I can more firmly state, ""Fist Bump Only"" towards him.
So Internet, WIBTA?
EDIT:
Hello Internet. Thanks for commenting. I see that everyone has mixed ratings for me, both great and not great, and I accept everyone's ratings.
Some other questions came up:
What do I do with the ""Peace be with you"" handshake? - The Church I am talking about actually does not do that specific handshaking time. There are handshakes during before/after service times, but in that case, I often just fist my hand when others offer a handshake, and usually everyone else just fist-bumps me back, without thinking much of it.
Why do I not want to shake hands, germaphobia? - I am kind of a germophobe, yes. I am also a sweat-phobe both ways, meaning I am afraid of shaking hands and the other person's hand being sweaty, and I'm also afraid of shaking hands and my own being sweaty. I also have Halitophobia, which is why when I talk to people I tend to keep a distance, and don't really let anyone whisper in my ear. One of my biggest pet peeves is when I'm chilling with people, and they suddenly exhale through their mouth within close proximity of me. Luckily, I just have to hold my breath for three seconds, and then things dissipate. This presents the question, ""Do I exhale through my mouth around people?"" The answer, no. I exhale through my nose. Another thing that I can't exactly take is that people also tend to squeeze hands when they shake hands, and my hands can't really take much of it.
Have I tried telling him I'm uncomfortable with physical contact? Well Yes. When it started a few months back, I tried telling him, I did fist-bumps, and then he kept repeating ""Oh, come on. Shake my hand!"" I repeated what I said, and he also kept repeating, but adding in, ""I don't bite"". I started resorting to faking sickness because I knew that he wouldn't listen to me if I told him I just did fist bumps. This wasn't just a problem that sprung up overnight, but something that happened over the course of a few months, and now, it's just gotten unbearable.
Have I shaken hands before? - Well, in a few instances, yes. But everyone around me knows to just give fist bumps at this point.
So much for caring - Let me just say this, we're all human, and all of us has a Rubbish Limit. I do go to church, yes, but I do not fit the stereotype that most people have about church goers. If W wanted to talk with me about his younger years, then I'd be all ears. I have had close friendships with people around his age. Most of them, I've had to mention, ""I don't like talking about myself if that's okay Tell me something about your first job"" or something else that's nostalgic.",,t3_1gtvuyn,AITA

unnameablethings,"AITA for ""stealing"" a stray cat?",2024-11-17T19:15:02.052000+0000,895,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gtl5ek/aita_for_stealing_a_stray_cat/,"I (25m) and my husband (28m) were in our backyard on Saturday when we saw a stray cat in the yard. We usually shoo them away because they stress out our (indoor-only) cat and eat the birds that come to our birdfeeders, so my husband yelled ""Hey, shoo!"" at the cat. Instead of running away, the cat came running up to him immediately, meowing a lot. We were like ""oh, I wonder if this is the neighbor's cat or something,"" and then noticed he was really skinny, DEFINITELY not neutered, and had a small injury on one foot. If he was a pet, he definitely wasn't being taken care of!
We thought maybe he was a lost or escaped pet at first, so we caught him and brought him inside to set him up quarantined from our cat with a litter box and food and water. Humane Society is closed on weekends, so we planned to call them Monday and in the meantime put his image up on our local lost pets Facebook page with our email address.
Today, we got an email. Here is the exact text of the email (names changed for anonymity):
""Hi will you please let Bongo out so he can come back towards home. He is a feral cat but he is loved in his neighborhood. He comes to my place all the time and he stays here at night then leaves and comes back later. - Laura.""
Laura and her sister who we'll call Sarah also responded to our Facebook post about a dozen times saying to let the cat go and asking if we got their email.
This gave us a dilemma, because like. The cat's not her cat, right? This is a neighborhood stray she's feeding, he's not neutered, he's not getting medical care. We can't just let an unneutered unvaccinated cat back out on the streets because some people would be sad he's not wandering around in the road. There's coyotes in our neighborhood! It's cold at night! He could get hit by a car or something! We responded on the Facebook post with
""Hi! Yes, we did get your email. In your email you said he is a neighborhood feral, and so does not have an owner or any regular medical care (his back foot is injured, he seems to have some parasites, and he is not fixed). He's a fantastic indoor cat and wonderfully suited for adoption, so we're going to take him by the Humane Society to get veterinary care, a microchip, and ideally a permanent owner.""
ABSOLUTE EXPLOSION. Laura and Sarah are now spamming the facebook post threatening to doxx us and call the police on us and show up at our house if we don't let ""their"" cat go.
I feel like we're probably ethically in the right here, but it's extremely stressful and upsetting. If it was their cat I'd never dream of not returning him, but like. He's not!!!! They're not taking care of him!! They're changing the story now to claim he's an indoor/outdoor cat, but if that's the case, why did they email me saying he's feral?

green_bean87,AITA for calling out my friend for not following the rules?,2024-11-18T19:16:42.839000+0000,12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gucwny/aita_for_calling_out_my_friend_for_not_following/,"Background: This is between me (21F) and my 3 roommates (all F 21/22). We all go to the same college and in the same club on campus. We make up the entire executive board of said club. This club has a constitution that we are supposed to follow.
We had been discussing over text message who was presenting what. Elle, the president, seemed to be getting frustrated. During club, Elle said we were going to vote on what to do at the last club meeting. We as an e-board had already discussed and made a decision on what to do for the last meeting. We do not just vote like that in club, we discuss as a group and decide, as per the constitution. She is also supposed to discuss changes with the rest of the e-board before doing anything and she did not. Elle also snapped at me when I mentioned I had downloaded an extension that would allow her to draw directly on the board instead of using the overhead cam to project her iPad (a terrible glare on it and I found the extension and checked that it worked while we were at work that day, specifically so that Elle could use it during the meeting, but she seemed to take my suggestion as an attack).
Afterward, I told Elle we needed to talk about what happened (waited to get home to say this instead of in front of everyone). Elle yelled, ""WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT"" and went to her room and slammed the door hard behind her. This seemed like an overreaction for the situation but I figured she needed some space.
The next day Elle stepped down as president of the club. This seemed like it came out of the blue. But I continued to give her space as she had not yet approached me.
The day after that, she unfriended me on all social media and removed herself from any group chats we were both in. At this point, I was very confused as to how asking to talk about her not following the constitutional rules turned into this.
She met up with our other 2 roommates that day, CeCe and Gina, and they all talked for hours at a cafe. Then they all went out without inviting me along, which is not typical of them. I asked CeCe and Gina if they would tell me anything. Gina ignored me completely and CeCe only said she couldn't tell me.
None of them have spoken to me in days. I did reach out to Elle over text and she ignored it. It’s hard living in an apartment where everyone is mad at me but will not tell me why. This seems like too much to be just a bad day. For her to cut me out completely, there has to be a bigger reason, and I would like to make things righ. I have thought so much on this and I can not pinpoint anything that I could have done that would cause this reaction. It really hurts because one day I have three great friends and the next I feel completely alone and exiled and have no idea why.
I am open to advice (please note that ""reaching out"" and ""waiting it out"" are not great advice as I have one tried that and it's been days, I can't wait it out forever.)",,t3_1gucwny,AITA

My MIL is notorious for giving advice when it's not solicited. My wife will never stand up to her mom and will end up breaking down after the call in my arms. I have heard it enough times where I am starting to speak up. They talk almost every day on the phone which is great, where I draw the line is MIL has her marriage, we have ours, don't get into business that you don't want anyone getting into of yours.
MIL loves to make comments on ""what we are doing wrong"" or ""what she did"" in cases where it's not asked for an not wanted. This morning thry were facetiming and she was critical of my wife not being stern enough with our daughter. I heard it but was trying to keep the peace and was doing something so i kept quiet. Minutes later with me in the room, she mentioned that ""we need to get her on a schedule"" and that we are ""f#$ING her up."" We have a schedule, it's the weekend, we spent 30 minutes in bed with our daughter on a Sunday. Really f#$ING her up right? While they were facetiming, our daughter was hungry and a little fussy so that's where the comment came in.
I lost it then, I said out loud, ""If I wouldn't have know, we're are babysitting her child, I didn't know she had another kid"" to my wifes bewilderment and her jaw down, she couldn't believe I said that. All I heard from their facetime is, ""I have to go, click"" as she scowled at my wife.
Wife isn't upset at me cause she knows her mom.was in the wrong but said I was an asshole.

Spirited-Attitude-29,AITA for talking to my half-sister even though her dad abused the rest of my family? ,2024-11-19T03:27:37.967000+0000,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gunuic/aita_for_talking_to_my_halfsister_even_though_her/,"I let my brother edit this to be sure it is fair:
I made some questionable choices regarding my complicated family history. My biological dad was an abusive, manipulative, and destructive person who left my mom, my brothers, and me in ruins. He cheated on her, stole everything, and caused harm that still echoes in our lives today. My mom survived his abuse and worked tirelessly to raise us, but she has never fully recovered. She’s now battling stage 4 cancer, with little support or joy in her life.
Despite all this, I chose to reach out to my 15-year-old half-sister—a child my dad had after leaving us. She lives with him even though he is abusive and a narcissist because her mom is a drug addict, and while I don’t have a relationship with my dad, staying in contact with her means I inevitably have to communicate with him. I kept this a secret from my mom because I knew it would upset her.
When my mom recently asked about my dad, I admitted to talking to my half-sister. She set boundaries and gave me an ultimatum: either stop talking to my sister or she won’t talk to me anymore. I told her I can’t stop talking to my half-sister because I want to be there for her, and now my mom wants nothing to do with me and has even asked for a family heirloom back. I know she’s carrying so much pain and might not have long to live, but instead of respecting her wishes, I’ve decided to maintain a relationship with my half-sister. My brothers, who have also suffered greatly, want nothing to do with my half-sister because of the connection to our dad, but I’ve ignored that, too.
In trying to help my half-sister, I’ve only brought more pain to my mom during this tough period and disregarded the boundaries she has set.

PaleSky6874,AITA for calling my husband selfish for eating a massive bowl of cereal?,2024-11-17T09:48:02.635000+0000,4265,1382,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gta853/aita_for_calling_my_husband_selfish_for_eating_a/,"Throwaway because this feels so ridiculously petty I can't believe I'm asking it.
Our kid (6) has a favourite cereal which is a branded chocolate hoop cereal. When full price it is 100% out of our budget and so we are almost never able to buy it and we buy her the cheap own-brand alternative (which she likes, but isn't anywhere near as good. But when it's 3x cheaper, you make do). We went shopping a few weeks ago, and to my happiness they had two boxes of her preferred brand massively reduced to clear (making them cheaper than the own brand). So I bought them. She was THRILLED.
We've been gradually getting through it (I try to limit how much sugary cereal she has anyway so generally she'll have a bowl of shreddies or bran flakes or similar and put the chocolate cereal on top. She's happy to do this because it makes the cereal last longer). We just opened the second box a couple of days ago. Well, this morning, my husband joined us for breakfast (normally he wakes before us and so has already eaten before we wake up). He then poured himself a HUGE bowlfull of the chocolate cereal. I was stunned, and immediately asked him what he was doing, and was he seriously eating that much (here is where I am probably an asshole - I shouldn't have commented in front of our kid. But he took me by surprise and I wasn't thinking). He shrugged and said yeah, that it was a ""normal"" amount of cereal to eat, he'd run out of ""his"" cereal, and it wasn't a big deal. He also said he'd done the exact same thing yesterday (having checked, I'd estimate he's had at least 1/3 of the entire box over those two bowls). I got annoyed and said that was unreasonable and kind of selfish.
While he has every right to eat as much food as he wants, and has every right to eat whichever cereal he wants, I think having a huge bowl of expensive cereal which was bought as a treat for our daughter is completely unreasonable. I asked him why on earth he couldn't have mixed it with cheap cereal to bulk out his bowl because this particular cereal is unaffordable usually. He made a comment about that box being gotten on offer so it wasn't expensive, and when I argued that it wasn't the point, that buying another box of it WOULD be expensive, he said ""then we just won't buy another box"". Our kid got upset, and then my husband snapped at me for saying anything in front of her, that it was MY fault our kid was upset, and said that I had now ruined his day. He sulkily ate his gigantic bowl and then stormed off to our room in a huff.
(He also said that he earns most of ""our"" money so he can eat what he wants - yes, he earns more, but WE have an agreed upon food budget. If he wants to buy expensive cereal with his own money then he can be my guest, but he spends his money on other things and this cereal came out of our family food budget).
AITA for calling him out for eating so much?
TL;DR: husband ate 1/3 box of expensive cereal which was unofficially bought for our daughter. He is angry that I called him selfish for doing so.
ETA: Because a few people brought it up in the comments - yes, husband was fully aware this is daughters favourite and was bought as a treat for her. The reason I said ""unofficially"" is because it was bought out of the family budget, and wasn't like a reward or something. Not because he was unaware of the situation.
ETA2: The box is supposed to contain 14 servings. Because she rations it, it usually lasts 3 or 4 weeks having it every day.
ETA3: Our grocery budget for the three of us is about £40-£50 a week (approx $50-65 according to Google). I don't see how I could possibly cut anything out.",,t3_1gta853,AITA

It's been over two weeks of him having the dog, with no adoption fee I'll add, and him having NO contact with me. I asked how the dog is settling in- nothing. I just blatantly have attempted calling over 10 times over this two weeks of having the gift puppy. I hear today he'll call me after going to a football game with our dad, and 10pm rolls around. My dad has a full phone call with me but doesn't mention my brother being with him still. I drive down and, sure enough my brother was next to my dad on the couch with the puppy in a kennel the whole time (side note-l don't hate kennels). They are both wasted and confused that I showed up after having my calls declined and, I pick up my dog with the kennel, since I had given that to my brother as well, and say my buy back policy is applicable and since my brother literally never paid me, I'm taking the puppy back. I feel guilty and also valid, am I the asshole? My dad called and disowned me saying he was ""done with you bitch"". Side note- 1 was just trying to get the vet and registration paperwork to my brother in the first place.",,t3_1gu0vuk,AITA
DTheDude97,AITA for not going to my sister's 40th birthday celebration?,2024-11-19T02:09:42.699000+0000,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gumc7r/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_40th_birthday/,"My sister just turned 40. This past Friday she had a little hotel celebration get together with just immediate family. I didn't really know about it until the day of. It started at around 6:00PM. I had to work that day and I also had a big exam I had to study for over the weekend for my Anatomy class at my local community college. The way my father explained it to me was he thought it was going to be like an all female event. (Which was wrong, it was a male and female event) My father had no intentions of going either for that reason and also because he just got off work and was tired. I sent my sister a text the morning of her birthday to wish her a happy birthday and I also got a card for her as well as $60.00 cash. I left my card with my mother with the cash inside so she could take it to the event with her to give to my sister. My mother texted me and told me, ""You and your Dad can bring the card with you to the hotel."" My mother was essentially trying to encourage my father and I to go. My father and I ended up not going. My Dad picks me up from work right after he gets off. We both get off at the same time of 4:30PM. My father called my mother and came up with an excuse and said that I still wasn't off work yet so we probably can't make it. (Which was not true. I was off beforehand and he was just trying to make up an excuse on why we couldn't come) When my Dad told my mother that, she was really upset. She felt like it was a bad excuse. She also said, ""DtheDude97 needs to give his card to her.""
My brother called me a couple of hours later and asked me if my father and I were coming and I told him, ""I'm not coming because I have to study."" He said, ""Okay"". My mom said, ""Family comes first"". The next day my brother told me that he thought it was messed up that me and my Dad didn't come to my sister's birthday celebration. He said all of our immediate family showed up. He also said that he felt like our Dad's excuse was a lame excuse. My brother also told me, ""I'm going to start forcing you to drive whether you like it or not because you could've went to the celebration on your own accord with the car Dad picks you up in."" I have my driver's license, but I don't really drive due to driving anxiety. I told my brother, ""Driving doesn't really have anything to do with it. I could've caught an Uber there."" He responded and said, ""People are going to start thinking something is wrong with you for being 27 and not able to drive. Your little cousins are passing you up and driving before you. You need to be driving by now. You need to be able to get yourself around by now."" I also told him I didn't really know about this event and how important it was supposed to be. It wasn't really discussed. I felt bad afterwards for not coming, and I feel like I owe my sister an apology.

ReddRev,AITA for suggesting to be late to help my friend move apartments?,2024-11-18T14:57:04.498000+0000,17,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gu6ko7/aita_for_suggesting_to_be_late_to_help_my_friend/,"A close friend of mine will be moving out of his parent's home next month and asked a bunch of people to help with moving - about 10 people volunteered, including his parents and himself. We all voted on a weekend, set a date on a Saturday and waited for more info. He's moving out from the town both of us grew up with to the city where I live; it's about an hour for me by public transport to his parent's house.
Yesterday he wrote into the group chat and asked to all assemble at his parent's house at 8am. To get there at 8am I'd have to get up at 6:30am. I suggested that instead I could wait at arrival point at 9am to help carry furniture and boxes up into his new apartment. At the time I didn't think it was a big deal, so I communicated lightly, offering to bring an electric drill too because I have one lying around. He said that he'd prefer me to be there at 8am. I texted him in private and said that that's really early for me and I'd prefer to join at arrival point. He reacted angrily, telling me I might as well not bother if that's my perspective - but that he'd be sure to remember it next time I'd need help.
I was surprised, and texted that I'm a little shocked by this, that I think it's normal to compromise with people when asking for help. The shock quickly turned into hurt, so I told him that reading such an angry text made me quite sad, and carefully explained my position. I really did want to help, and this was not a request out of laziness. I'm not a morning person, and getting up this early would make me feel sick all day and result in me having a complete breakdown at the end (physically can't sleep before 1am). I also apologized for communicating so lightly about it in the beginning. I reiterated that I'd really love to help moving and get there at arrival point, spend the rest of the day helping with the move. And finally asked for a call if he had time, as I didn't want to leave this unresolved.
He did not call, instead saying that yes, he was frustrated because he felt like I didn't wanna help. He said he wants me there at 8am but I'd obviously not be expected to carry everything or work without a break. I feel that he missed the point there a bit. I asked him why he would like me to be there at 8am instead of joining a little later. Getting up this early really is a boundary for me.
He texted me again this morning. Completely dodged my question, instead saying that he's asked me three times now to show up at 8am. Telling me he sees how my priorities lie and to not bother showing up. He also told me to think about my priorities and my wrongdoing here.
So: what do you think? AITA in this situation?
TLDR: I live in the city, my friend's moving here from an hour away. He wants me to be at his at 8am, I'd prefer to join at 9am at arrival point because that wouldn't kill me with sleep deprivation (not a morning person at all...). He thinks this is unacceptable.",,t3_1gu6ko7,AITA

My 3 year old is special needs and doesn’t talk much so this post doesn’t apply to him. But AITA if I tell my 10 year old and 7 year old Santa isn’t real? My kids are not spoiled or entitled, but of course children always have “Santa” excitement/somewhat of “expectations”. I just can’t afford to do it this year. It’s been a rough year, I haven’t been working, my 3 year old starts Pre-K for students with disabilities next week, and I can finally go back to work (fingers crossed I can find a decent job 🤞🏻) I’m so behind on bills it’s crazy, so I just don’t think I can make any magic happen this year.
My parents were never rich, but they tried their best to make the “Santa” spirit happen. I’ve always done ANYTHING I could to do this as well, but this year by far sucks the most.
Am I going to crush childhood dreams? I don’t want my kids to be upset, I just feel that telling them would help them understand better that sometimes people go through financial hardships. They know their mama tries her best but I just want to see AITA?",,t3_1gu8sls,AITA
FewResearcher3245,AITA for confiding in family about something personal? Did I deserve this breakup? ,2024-11-18T23:03:15.620000+0000,5,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1guiclm/aita_for_confiding_in_family_about_something/,"My 23f boyfriend 28m broke up with me for confiding in family. Dated 5 months. Been having symptoms for a month and decided last week I would go get tested for everything. Got my results and had BV. A few days later got a call, said they were wrong and I actually have an STI, have my partner get tested.
I called him and he immediately said “I’m so sorry I dont know how that happened”. I wasnt mad or anything, kind of assumed that maybe my bodys crazy and it just happened. We talked, agreed we trust each other and shit happens. No big deal.
He got tested and his doctor said it can lie asymptomatic in his system for 6 months. I believed him and figured makes sense since his last partner was a month before me. Seems to add up, but still a little odd that we’ve been doing the deed for 5 months before it came up.
He came to spend the night. I was quietly talking about it with my brother’s girlfriend who I consider family. She’s heard about my symptoms from the start. I wanted to fill her in on what it actually was. Boyfriend and I left to get food for everyone and he was off. I asked what was wrong and he said “it sounded like you were telling her” I said “yeah, I was”. He said it’s a deal breaker for him,I crossed a line. If I wanted to talk about it I shouldve talked to him. I genuinely didnt and still dont think it was a big deal I confided in family about my body.
His reaction was HUGE compared to what was going on IMO. He was hyperventilating and panicking. He said I shouldve thought about how this would make him look, how my family will think he’s disgusting for giving their daughter/little sister an STI. I explained that my brothers been through it and that we dont judge, my bro and his Gf are the only people to know and they are so understanding. If I didnt trust them I wouldnt have mentioned it. I dont have friends close enough to confide in. I live with my bro, he and his girlfriend are my best friends.
He said he wont spend the night bc hes embarrassed and humiliated. Dropped me and the food off and said hed wait outside so we could talk. Food inside I went outside to see him driving off. Stood there for a second feeling awful for hurting him and shitty that he would just leave.
He said he needed space. I texted him apologizing the next morning saying that I didnt consider his feelings and I should have and Id do anything to fix this. He said he “cant” and hed be by to drop my stuff off and to get his stuff ready. Dropped a box off (every single piece of me he could find) and when I saw him outside I ran out to ask to talk. Got in his car, apologized profusely and said I fucked up. He said he “doesnt want to work on things and hes done with our relationship. What I did was awful, he can never trust me again”. AITA for confiding in family? I understand I hurt him. I wasn’t treating the situation like a big deal when I found out my results and neither was he, so I just thought that it wasn’t one. I’m confused. Heartbroken.",,t3_1guiclm,AITA

I thought we both understood one another and the points we made and that we would work on them together to overall strengthen our relationship. That following week everything seemed to be going normal until one night she randomly texted me saying she doesn’t like me anymore, I asked her what I did to make her say that but she never responded. The following morning I texted her with a good morning and she responded with a very dry text back. Later that day I called her to ask her what made her say what she said previously that night and all she said was that she was drunk and that she didn’t feel like telling me why she said it. The next couple of days she didn’t try to reach out to me and we didn’t talk. That following weekend I reached out to her asking if we’re broken up and she said yes and to ultimately leave her alone to which I did until last week when she reached out asking if we could meet and have a talk with each other. I agreed to it and we planned to have it this past Friday, but the week leading up to our meet up she was acting like everything was back to normal and never actually apologized about what she did, and that’s why I’m asking for everyone’s advice because it rubbed me the wrong way and made me kind of shut down emotionally and not really care about us having the conversation. In my mind I feel like if she doesn’t respect me enough to at least let me know she’s breaking up with me rather than ghost me then I shouldn’t worry about having us having the talk, AITA?",,t3_1gu29mz,AITA

I then found out recently that her partner was also diagnosed with cancer, so I booked a trip to come visit for six weeks as she will get the results of a recent CT scan soon to see if the medication has been working, and he just had surgery so figured I would be of use around the house. I have a brother who lives in the same area as her, but only visits once every few months and a sister who pretends she doesn't exist.
I last visited in June of this year for five weeks and prior to that last December for five weeks. Each time my work has been great, helping move my shifts around and providing loads of time off to spend time with her (including using my holidays). This time was a bit more challenging as I've used up all my holidays so they agreed I could work a portion from Canada and take the rest as compassionate leave.
Booking the flights coming over here was a challenge, due to the time of year there are very few direct flights from the city I live in which meant a return flight in economy was over £1,600.00. I ended up getting a flight via London for £1,300.00 which is of course still quite costly given I only earn about £26,000.00 per year.
I've been back a week so far, everything has been good, tonight however my mum hands me a cheque for the exact amount of my airfare. Of course I'm grateful for this however I was a bit thrown off by it, one because she did it so quickly and out of the blue and two by how transactional it felt. Canada is a very expensive place, and so far in the last week for example I've spent over $200 on groceries, and a further $100.00 getting around (taxis and whatnot as I don't drive). She could tell straight away something was off by my body language, so I was honest with her and said I'm surprised she rushed into giving me this considering Christmas is coming up and I don't quite know how much of an impact being here will have on me financially (although it kind of flew out, I wish I hadn't said it in hindsight).
Naturally my mum flew off the handle, saying that I'm greedy, that no matter how much she gives me it's never enough (she gave me $15,000 last Christmas to thank me for coming to visit and to help towards the purchase of a house eventually). She basically told me not to mention money to her again. She was then crying when I came back upstairs to talk to her later on and told me to go away.
I spoke to a friend who said while they understand where I'm coming from I probably didn't handle it the best way. I think a combination of my jet lag, dealing with my work, the stress of what's been going on here and me worrying about how much I've already spent so far resulted in me speaking without thinking.
Tldr: AITA for suggesting to my mum that the compensation she gave me for my flight costs isn't enough?",,t3_1gunws8,AITA

On Halloween they were supposed to be here at 6:30 to go trick-or-treating, my kids are teens so they already had plans but cancelled to spend time with them instead. At 7:15 we called and they said they were '5 mins away'. 22 minutes later, they arrived without any concerns.
This inspired a new rule for me, I called it the 5 min rule. Basically, if you tell me you're gonna be somewhere at a time and aren't, after 5 mins I will leave. If we are meeting to eat or something, and you're late, we will order and eat without you, we will leave when we finish even if they are just getting there.

I met my friends during my masters degree two years ago, and we still keep in touch via an IG chat we created for the four of us to talk and share videos that remind us of each other. One of them went to another country to study, however, when she comes back from vacation I always do my best to see her and make her feel appreciated, driving more than 1 hour to go see her. And between the four of us we have our reunions/going out. Throughout the year I have been mentioning to them to remember to save my wedding date on their calendar. I finally sent out my invitations. Out of the 3 of them, only 1 (the one who lives the furthest away) replied and wrote that she would attend. My boyfriend and I gave more than 10 days for people to RSVP digitally. So during those days we sent out several reminders through the RSVP app. Thinking that my other two friends were having trouble, I texted them in the chat to let them know if they hadn't gotten it, to let me know so I could send it to them again and I also notify them of the RSVP deadline. My message was completely ignored, neither of them replied, not even to say ""yes, I received it, I'll reply soon."" Imagine my surprise when after reminders and after the RSVP closed etc, neither of them replied to the RSVP, not even to say that they weren't going to attend. I feel really hurt. I wanted to share this day with them, and what hurts the most is that they couldn't even text me that they wouldn't attend, I would have been able to understand that.

They’re great most of the time, but my mother is a bit of a perfectionist, or narcissist. I don't know how to explain it but she always tries to pick at something, no matter how minute or inconsequential, so she can show her ""superiority.""
Anyway, my husband has this quirk where he likes to hang out on the stairs. Sometimes he’s on the landing, sometimes the top, sometimes the bottom. He’ll sit, lie down, or even drape himself in weird positions. He’s not hurting anyone—it’s just him. It’s his way of chilling, and honestly, I find it endearing.
My mother was not a fan. She kept giving him side-eyes and finally said something like, “Why is he sitting there? He’s not a child. He can sit in the living room like an adult.”
I shrugged and told her, “It’s our house. He can sit however and wherever he wants.”
That set her off. She started going on about how it’s “weird” and “not proper” and how it’s embarrassing that he acts like this. I didn’t budge—I wasn’t about to tell my husband where he can or can’t sit in his own home. Things escalated, and eventually, she stormed out in a full-on hissy fit, saying she wouldn’t “be a part of this nonsense.” She took the car and went to a hotel in town, leaving my dad behind.
The thing is, she has no reason to go upstairs, so it's not like my husband was disrupting her. He was just using his phone (sometimes he reads books on the stairs too, but not this weekend). The only things upstairs are my husband’s office, our room, and a small half bathroom, (a half bathroom is a bathroom without any bathing utilities, just a sink and toilet.)
My dad and I had a great night catching up. He didn’t care one bit about the “stair thing” and just laughed it off. Now I’m left wondering if I was too harsh on my mom. I know she can be dramatic, but maybe I should’ve tried to smooth things over instead of digging my heels in. I get it's not traditional (I can't find the right word, correct, professional, formal?) but he's my family too, and it's our house. He can do whatever he likes.",,t3_1gt5ck5,AITA

My (32F) SIL (30F, spouse's sister) is getting married early next year and had a plans for a lot of events before that, like a bridal shower for just her, a wedding shower for her and her fiancé, a bachelorette party, and a trip to look at wedding dresses. A lot of these dates and times were TBA or tentative. I'll mention that I am not part of the bridal party, which I don't care about since I'm busy anyway, but it's important to mention. I did go on the wedding dress trip and ended up picking the dress she ultimately bought (and was super happy about).
I had let her know two months in advance that I wouldn't be able to make one of the pre-wedding events (which had a date confirmed but not a time) because it fell at the exact same time as another obligation. I honestly thought that I would be able to do both events in the same day, but as soon as the pre-wedding event time was announced, I immediately let her know. Again, I was not part of any event planning for this or part of the bridal party. She did not let me know this was an issue until two months later, but I had already known she was upset because she told other people who later told me that she wants me to apologize because I didn't say act sorry about missing. She sent me a text message where she tried to guilt trip me and act as if I have not been active anything wedding-related. I ultimately didn't answer because 1) she is the type of person that you can't reason with 2) I had nothing nice to say and 3) anything I said was just going to be twisted and used against me.
Since then, she has continued to send me messages telling me how terrible I am (not this nicely worded) and essentially just trying to continually guilt trip me. Again, I have not answered any of these messages because of the above reasons. I have since been uninvited to the wedding.
While I still don't plan to reply, AITA for not apologizing, especially since it's causing stress in my spouse's family?
EDIT: Because there have been several questions, I’ll try to answer them. I tried not to include too much info just because I have friends and family on Reddit.
The obligation was an opportunity that I had waited almost 10 years for, which is longer than I’ve known my spouse or my SIL, but never thought I’d have the chance to do. The obligation required six different dates at a specific time that I needed to be able to attend, including the date and time of the pre-wedding event. This obligation also required around a month of work prior to the above dates.
The requested apology is for missing the pre-wedding event and not sounding sorry about it. That’s it. Nothing else. SIL and spouse were raised in a family where “you drop everything” for family events, even if you have something else important but not family related going on.
Spouse is not attending the wedding in solidarity with me.
I included the bit about me going to the wedding dress shopping day because I’ve been accused of not being supportive. There have been other things I’ve done (offered to help plan [was never taken up on offer], gave advice on the wedding website, giving wedding checklists to help with planning, etc.), but this was the biggest example, especially since I drove over an hour to do this with SIL because it was important to her.
EDIT 2: There was another comment that asked why I didn’t just reply. I did say above why I haven’t, but I’ll add more context for the sake of such.
Spouse has reached out to SIL at the request of MIL. Even though spouse has done nothing wrong and should not have been included anyway, SIL has been increasingly aggressive towards spouse and has been insulting towards spouse, myself, and our home (where she has stayed multiple times). Each time, spouse has tried to deescalate the situation, but SIL continues to ramp up her texts, including texting out of the blue to guilt trip spouse.",,t3_1gtv6yo,AITA
Bvbkay,AITA for not helping my friend celebrate her baby shower ,2024-11-18T18:36:14.735000+0000,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gubw4f/aita_for_not_helping_my_friend_celebrate_her_baby/,"(Context) she’s a coworker I met over 1 yr and half ago and we’ve become really close friends. Shes on her 2nd pregnancy with a homeless meth addict she met working night shift at 7 eleven. ( i know). Anyways, he had recently gone to jail for getting high and driving to the casino with their 1 YEARD OLD SON, and left him in the car to go play inside. (my friend was working a night shift at our job) this was less than 3 1/2 months ago, instead of jail time they offered him a month rehab to which he just recently finished. He’s been home about 4 weeks and my friend called me yesterday to tell me about her pregnancy. She said she was upset because during the phone call because I did not sound excited nor did I offer to throw her a baby-shower or gender reveal, to which I replied that I wouldn’t be a celebrating her child not because I’m not happy for her but because I truly can not agree with the circumstances surrounding the situation.
Should I just suck it up and be supportive? Am I being too judgmental? I just can’t believe that she prized this guy after everything he’s done.",,t3_1gubw4f,AITA
Tefi1331,AITA for telling my family I won’t be spending all Thanksgiving weekend with them?,2024-11-17T18:09:49.186000+0000,360,143,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gtjnnm/aita_for_telling_my_family_i_wont_be_spending_all/,"I (28F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been dating for a little over a year and a half. Last year we didn’t go to each other’s Christmas or Thanksgiving celebrations because we hadn’t been dating long and we didn’t want to rush anything. With that being said, for the past 4 years, my family and I have been doing a Thanksgiving weekend spending Wednesday night thru Sunday morning together. My older brother and his wife live 9 hours away from us. A choice they made as they bought a home back in January (even though they both work from home) and we were so happy for them. We still are! And her parents live in the same city so we understand her wanting to be close to them. Anyways, we would do Thanksgiving on Thursday, Black Friday shopping on Friday and then Saturday my older brother would go and spend time with his buddy, usually most of the day. While his wife, my mom and I would hang out at home.
This year, my boyfriend and I have chosen to try and make it to everyone’s holiday celebrations (his parents are divorced so he has two on his side vs. the one on my side). So we (my boyfriend and I) made the decision to go to my family on Thursday and then Friday/Saturday we would spend it with his side of the family. Well I told my mom the plan and she about freaked, she said things like “you’re brother has to work on Friday, who’s going to stay with (wife’s name)”, “so you’re only spending one day with us?” etc…. I stuck my ground and I told her our plan was one we both felt comfortable with.
As a courtesy, I made a group chat with just my older brother and sil in order to tell them our plans so there were no surprises. My older brother said “why can’t you hang out with us Thursday/Friday and with them Saturday/Sunday” and I told him that’s not what we agreed to. He then proceeds to say “I’m not happy about it either since the whole point is to go up there and spend time with my immediate family” I told him I understood but this was the only way we could get to everyone. He said “it was unfair to them to drive 2 days to be here and only see me for 1 day and have a half ass commitment from me” He tried to throw the fact that we see my boyfriends mom multiple times a year and we only see them maybe twice.
I told them that their choice to live several hours away is not my responsibility to accommodate to, that we drove to see them in July and spent almost a whole week with them. I even suggested we spend Thursday/Friday with my boyfriend’s family and Saturday/Sunday with my family and my brother said “no because we leave Sunday”. His wife chimed in and said that me saying that their choice to live far away is not my responsibility to accommodate to, hurt their feelings. I apologized as it was never my intention to hurt their feelings but it doesn’t negate the fact that it is true.
But now it’s eating away at me, so AITA?",,t3_1gtjnnm,AITA

I was traveling with my friend on a bus and happened to ask her for some water, but she didn't have any. A woman in her 30s wearing a hijab offered me her bottle but I refused because she's a stranger, as simple as that, no mention of religion or anything.
As soon as I refused she said- but you just said you're thirsty. I politely replied that yes, but you're a stranger, hence.
She was quick to reply with 'is it because of my religion?' i said no, it's not, it's only because i dont know you and idk if it's safe. But she kept on insisting saying it's safe to drink it and i should take it. I said no again. She scoffed and said something under her breath about me being racist, atp I had enough and told her to shut it and i dont want her water.
A few other passengers noticed and one of them, a young guy, commented something hurtful to her religion which I'll not quote, but the woman was noticeably taken aback and got down at the next stop itself, and i feel this fiasco will play in her mind for a while, which is not good and i should've just accepted the water as a comeback to the guy who commented, so AITA?
Edit - it was a pink opaque bottle.",,t3_1gwn8ga,AITA

While he’s always been nice to me, I’ve never seen him as a father figure, he came into my life when I was already an adult, and we’re friendly but not particularly close.
I told my mom that I plan to walk myself down the aisle as a way to honor my independence and my dad’s memory. She got really upset, saying her boyfriend has “earned” the spot by being there for me all these years. She even accused me of disrespecting her relationship and trying to “erase” my dad, which couldn’t be further from the truth.
Now her boyfriend is avoiding me, and my mom keeps calling me selfish and saying I’m ruining the wedding before it even starts. A few family members are also weighing in, saying I should let him do it to keep the peace. But this is my wedding, and I feel like I should have the final say. AITAH?",,t3_1gwl76e,AITA

For perspective, I am an only child. Christmas morning was always done at home with my parents, and after opening gifts, we’d head over to my grandparents to celebrate with them. They all still live local. My husband is the middle of 3, and they often had family that lived out of state. So Christmas morning was sometimes at their home, sometimes at a grandparent’s out of state, etc. we alternate our holidays between Xmas and Thanksgiving with our families. Before having kids, we’d stay with them for a week or long weekend over Christmas. After having kids, I want to be home for Christmas morning, and then spend the rest of the day with my family or his family depending on year.
Our kids are still young, (2,1) but it is still such a special moment for me and I want it to be sacred and intimate amongst the four of us. We only get so many years of little kids on Christmas morning and I want to soak up every single moment. His parents live 3 hours away and are having his siblings come the 22nd-30th. No one else has kids yet. I told my husband that we should have our kids open up presents on Xmas morning, and then make the drive to their place shortly after. He is calling me selfish and inconsiderate of his parents’ feelings because it would mean the world to them to watch the grandkids open presents from Santa. His mom has made comments in the past how Santa would always travel for them wherever they went (being passive aggressive towards my feelings on it). We had the same argument last year. I told my husband that they had their turn with their own kids, and this is now about us and our children. I still want to see and celebrate with his family, but only after we have Christmas just the 4 of us on that morning. Am I being unreasonable?
TLDR; husband thinks we shouldnt exclude his family from watching the kids open presents on Xmas morning, and I want that moment to be intimate to the four of us only, then head to his family after.",,t3_1gwg6r9,AITA

My mom ended up inviting 50 guests (meaning I would cover the costs for 20 of her guests but she would have to cover the costs for 30 of her guests).
The vendor payments are now due and and she is refusing to cover her costs. She is playing the victim and has said the following things:
she can’t afford to pay as agreed
she will ask each of her 30 extra guests to cover their own costs
She does not think she will enjoy the wedding so I should remove her AND her guests from the guest list
She is seeking a loan from the bank to pay for those costs
I have killed all her excitement and spirit

Sad-Contribution652,AITA for defending my daughters comments towards my other daughter being single?,2024-11-21T06:12:29.941000+0000,3157,227,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw9o5g/aita_for_defending_my_daughters_comments_towards/,"My daughter (17f, Emily) has been dating this boy (17m, Zach) for around 2 -2 1/2 months now and he recently came to visit us, and this is the first time he has came over for dinner, and this is Emilys first bf. Zach is a very lovely boy and very outgoing. When he came in and saw me he says ""Emily, I didn't know you have 2 sisters"". I laughed as even though it's cliche I know he's trying to be nice. The entire time at dinner he was very polite but he is also a very outgoing kid. He would say stuff such as what a lovely dinner, this food is great, your backyard is beautiful, etc, etc. So while you could say he was trying to be overly polite, he was still a very sweet and kind kid. Emily is a more shy and reserved person so I felt they were really great for each other. Emily is also very sweet and positive, another thing they have in common that I appreciated. My husband also hit it off with him and they were engaging in sports banter, and eventually came to trash talking some football team owner.
My older daughter (amy,19), however kept grilling the poor guy. Asking if he would pay for dates, to which he said yeah, and then she asks how he has money, and he said his job, then she started talking about making time for Emily, in between school friends and a job. Then it came onto how they would get to dates and she started asking him about his license, she then started to ask about protecting her making comments on his stature (hes on the shorter side and kind of chubby, like 5'7 and maybe a little overweight, nothing crazy however) and he seemed to be getting uncomfortable so I brought out dessert, which he again complimented, and my husband brought up sports to change topics.
After he left I asked her why she would do that. She said that he seemed to nice, and cliche, as if he was faking it. I said so people cant be nice these days? You made it weird for him and Emily, Emily didn't deserve that neither did he. She said that she just didn't like that vibe as no-one is that nice or positive it was definetely forced. Emily butted in and said that she really didnt appreciate that and said that Amy's reasoning didn't make sense. Amy said that she didn't care if it was awkward as she wanted to grill him, and that she doesn't like him because he seemed fake. Emily said, that Amy was messed up and I agreed. Amy then said that he was some dumb weak kid faking being nice, and this upset Emily, and me. Emily then said in a fuss ""You only say that because your single and no one will date you"". She has been slightly sensitive about this as she hasn't been in a committed relationship yet.This upset Amy and Amy asked why I didn't say anything or stop her from going to her room. I said that she just insulted her bf and that she deserved it, she told me I should punish her and was being a bad parent and now Amy isn't talking to me and I feel that maybe a personal insult like that was to far.",,t3_1gw9o5g,AITA

I’ve tried to be patient, but it’s gotten to the point where I’m worried something will break or get ruined.
Last week, I had a small gathering at my place, and Jess brought her dog without asking. The dog ended up spilling drinks and knocking over some decorations. I was stressed out and asked Jess to take the dog outside for a bit. She got upset and said I was being unreasonable.
After that, I told her I’d prefer if she didn’t bring her dog over anymore. She got really mad and said I was being a bad friend. Now I’m feeling guilty, but I just want to enjoy my space without worrying about the dog destroying everything.

We were actually pretty close. She now lives with his parents bc she cheated on her husband, the new bf now lives there too.
We moved to an apartment but still get our items shipped to our parents since our place is sketchy.
I had bought Coachella tickets and it was sent to his house. Well, 2 weeks before Coachella the person I was going to Coachella with got COVID and so we decided to sell our tickets.
Only problem is, my ticket never came. we kept asking everyone who lived at the house for weeks if they had seen the package to which they said no. We searched the living room and kitchen but nothing came up.
A month prior to this his aunt had told his mom that she was selling Coachella tickets that her bf had gotten from his niece. It never crossed my mind that this ticket was mine.
I was starting to get stressed bc the ticket was $600 and I was about to have to drive to the venue to pick up my ticket and go to the concert alone.
The DAY before Coachella my bfs aunt confesses to her crime. Her bf had stolen my ticket and had been trying to sell it off. His aunt tried to say she had no idea it was my ticket bc the package had no name, this is a lie.
once I hear about it I immediately start shaking and sobbing feeling betrayed and that we stressed out over nothing.
Since they probably already sold the ticket I couldn’t even go to Coachella. My bf called his mom to tell her how fucked up this is and his parents agree.
She never apologizes just kept up her lies and excuses. I was so fed up that I said “you know it’s illegal to steal other ppls mail, I could go to the police about this”. This upset his aunt and I felt bad about this.
My bf said the right thing to do is for my aunt to send us the $600.
We haven’t talked about this incident since with them but I know they talk shit about me to their whole family bc that’s what they do. When I go to his family parties I just stay quiet and act friendly.
I’m an extremely sensitive person and the thing that hurt the most about this situation is that someone close to me could lie and betray me like that after seeing how stressed me and her nephew was.
I feel like the asshole bc I’ve created a rift between him and his ex-favorite aunt. I still feel guilty. Did I overreact? Did I mess up his relationship with his family?",,t3_1gw6gs9,AITA
savinathewhite,AITA for expecting not to have to pay for Thanksgiving groceries?,2024-11-20T23:31:16.916000+0000,6743,865,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw1stq/aita_for_expecting_not_to_have_to_pay_for/,"EDIT TO UPDATE: (I hope this is permitted) I did cancel this entirely, and thank you everyone for your kind advice and encouragement! We will be having our dinner at home instead.
—-
I have never posted here before, so my apologies if I make any mistakes.
I (54f) have been invited by a friend (50f) who I will call Ann, to come to her house for Thanksgiving.
We all live in Italy, but spent many years in the USA, and have several American friends in the area.
Ann heard that I make a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at my house every year for my family and a couple friends (6 people total).
It is quite difficult to get all of the supplies here (no buying canned pumpkin, or cranberry sauce!), so I make every single thing from scratch. Over the years, I’ve also acquired all the dishes and tools and spices - know suppliers for the more exotic things, and am an all around good cook.
So Ann, who was born in China but lived in the USA for 20+ years, asked if I would come to her beautiful (and much bigger) home, and “teach her” how to make the whole dinner.
For a group of 12 people instead of the usual 6.
I was hesitant at first, because we live a very modest lifestyle, and Ann and her (British) husband are very well off, but I figured it would still be fun, and I would enjoy putting on the feast for new people and in a beautiful kitchen.
After I agreed, the problems began. First, Ann wanted to have the dinner on a day that isn’t Thanksgiving, to make it more convenient. I decided it wasn’t all that important, since we live in Italy. So it is scheduled for the Sunday prior to the actual day.
Then when we were planning to meet to go shopping for all the ingredients, she asked if I could do all the shopping and she would “reimburse me for her half”.
I asked what she meant, and she said that I’d be paying for half of everything.
So not only would I be doing all the shopping, all the planning, all the cooking and teaching her as well, but now I’m expected to pay for the food?
I told her I could not do this (we really don’t have the budget!) so now she’s trying to alter the menu she agreed to (turkey & fixings, candied yams, roasted veggies, an appetizer, and pie). Really a modest dinner by American standards.
She then made a comment that “her” friends don’t “eat like pigs”.
She then went to another guest with my recipes and asked her to prepare my pumpkin pie so she didn’t have to buy the ingredients.
Bear in mind, Ann and her husband are very wealthy. I’d estimate the whole dinner for 12 might cost €200 for the ingredients, and my labor Ann gets for free.
She thinks I’m being “stubborn and ungenerous” (ie an AH)
My family thinks Ann is taking advantage of my kindness and her miserly ways are ridiculous, since she’d spend double that amount for lunch out on a whim.
So AITA for refusing to “contribute” to the meal or be bullied into this nonsense? My family wants me to just bow out and tell her I’m not comfortable with her attitude. I’m tempted, because this feels toxic and manipulative.",,t3_1gw1stq,AITA

For first period i have English 4, we all had to do a group assignment and it was a group discussion and after the discussion we had to answer the 5-6 questions the teacher gave us.
After 15 minutes, (after the teacher handed us the assignment) the group did not do anything, not even touch the paper. There are two guys and one girl. The two guys were on their phone playing video games while the girl was just scrolling on social media. So i decided to take responsibility in taking the paper and doing the work. Mind you, I tried to make them contribute by asking them questions, but they weren’t answering me.
After 20 Minutes, I finished the questions and had the paper near me, i put my name and claimed to be finished, but the group expected me to put their names as well when they did NOT help me at all. They left the work to me, but expected me to put their names on it since we are a group.
Today, I walked in class and it seems like they’re all ignoring me, apparently one of the guys told me that it was my fault that they didn’t contribute and that all i do is hog the paper, but the paper was in front of the guys for 15 minutes.

Potato3344,AITA for not caring that my ex has cancer?,2024-11-21T06:43:02.152000+0000,1062,191,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwa4lc/aita_for_not_caring_that_my_ex_has_cancer/,"I (27F) had my first relationship right after graduating high school and it lasted for 4 years. I was a straight laced shy and super socially awkward kid. I made friends with a guy in my class who was practically the opposite of me. Outgoing, liked to party, take lots of risks, and overall wanted to have a good time and didnt take anything too seriously.
We dated for 4 years. We honestly should have never dated. It was trainwreck of a relationship. One of my deal breakers was smoking. For personal reasons I didn't want to deal with it in regards to a SO. He however told me he didn't smoke only for me to find out he did. Now you probably are wondering why I never just left. You see that was where the begging, crying and promising to change part came in. Which gullible me would give in and say okay to every time. He just continued to lie throughout the relationship and it wasnt just for smoking, but many other things. I found out he was telling everyone I was some gold digger despite me paying for 70% of our dates and things while he crashed in my place. He did not respect a ""no"" in terms of intimacy. Told me he ""almost"" cheated on me. He was never reliable or on time to anything. Being with him made me into the ugliest version of myself. Anyways eventually after 4 years he dumped me. Claimed he hated me and was embarrassed to be seen with me. It is what it is. I was heartbroken for a bit. 4 years of a fairly manipulative relationship kinda took its toll on me and I was probably fairly attatched to him. I had entered my young adulthood with no sense of identity either and never took the chance to explore and develop myself.
9 months later he messaged me on my birthday. All he had to say was ""I know theres nothing to be happy about rn, but happy birthday."" At that point something clicked. I was lowkey flourishing during lockdown... so he could speak for himself. I messaged him to delete my number and proceeded to block him on everything. Figured that bridge was burned time to move on. I dont want to bring baggage into any new friendships/ relationships.
5years later. I am happy... pretty content when out of nowhere my best friend messages me saying my ex reached out to her. He claimed he wanted her to give me a letter since he assumed I was still mad at him. He claimed he wanted to thank me for a lot of things, but to also invite me to his funeral if I would go because he was dying from stage 3 cancer. Well my response to my friend was ""Whats any of that gotta do with me?"" She was a little surprised. Said sure he never treated me well, but that what he was going through was awful. Others shared a similar sentiment. Don't get me wrong. What he is going through is devestating, but it literally does not impact my life. My circle is small, but I am a ride of die for those people in that circle and he removed himself long ago. I gave him my email for the letter. Should I have more empathy or am I a jaded asshole?",,t3_1gwa4lc,AITA

The business was growing and I could make much more money if I helped full time. She often said I was a natural at leadership and design.

She pulled a cover with a lot of violence from the wood beams they should use that day. I asked her three times not to for she could harm herself or others but she wouldn’t listen. The beams were knocked out to the floor very loudly and our nephew was terrified. I snapped and yelled at her to stop rushing things and she looked at me in fury. All the staff were embarrassed and kind of scared. We headed back to the car and I offered to take our nephew home but she yelled at me that he was HER nephew and she picked him up to spend the day with her. She also said that I had no right calling her off in front of the staff. I just gave up and left. We stayed back and forth for hours last night and I decided to leave the partnership cause this is not a one time thing. She refuses to define my responsibilities or let me do only office work but also, grows angry at me when I call her wrongs even if is in particular.

It started with a lot of drama with his mom which stemmed into her talking shit about us to the rest of the family. We recently had our first baby in June and of course, this has made everything just a bit more complicated. Family has had issues with:
Us not wanting hospital visitors
Having very minimal visitors for the first 2 months
Not wanting anyone smoking around the baby (his whole family are chain smokers) None of his family have checked in, offered any help, asked to see the baby, etc. but are very bitter that we haven’t invited them. I had a very hard postpartum, struggling with PPA and their constant complaints have really contributed to that.
Since having the baby, my husband has been excellent at standing up for us and being the bad guy with his family. All communication with his family goes through him and he’s not afraid to piss people off for the good of his primary family (him, me and baby).
My husbands birthday was last week and every year we have his family over for a little party. Even though things have been tough with them, we thought it might be a nice way to try to smooth things over. We went back and forth with it for a while but ultimately agreed to do it.
My husband sent out a group text the week before with the invite and just asking that no one smoke at our house, even outside. This was because
We didn’t want people smoking then coming in and being around or holding baby.
Last year they left cigarette butts all over our yard and our dogs tried to eat them which we didn’t want to happen again.
There was no pushback at all. Everyone came over and it was fine. Then after, my husband checked our ring cameras and saw his grandpa go outside multiple times to smoke. One of which he went outside and our doorbell camera caught him telling an uncle “don’t tell them I’m smoking, they said we’re not allowed to” to which the uncle responded with saying “who do they think they are” and calling us controlling. As everyone was leaving, it caught more family members making fun of us and laughing at us. Less than 5 minutes after the grandpa smoked, he came in and held the baby.
A lot of our issues with his family in the past have centered around them not treating us like adults, not taking us seriously and just being very disrespectful. We are very upset that the only thing we asked was mocked and not taken seriously.
Are we the assholes for the no smoking rule? What do we do next. Do we say something? Or just keep quiet? If we say something, it will likely start a lot of drama. If we don’t, this will just continue to happen.",,t3_1gwpmki,AITA

She baked them specifically for me, she was so thoughtful and used all vegan ingredients. It made me feel both so valued and cared for but also stressed because I knew I wouldn't like them, because I can not handle the chewy texture of them. But she didn't know that (so here I took her word for it, but that part is actually a little bit complicated- check the edit) I love the chocolate flavor so she must have thought i would ike brownies too.
I thanked and then told her I'm really not good with chewy textures. She insisted that I take a bike so I did. I could barely swallow it. smiled and hid my disgust the best I could because I knew she would be offended.
I must suck at faking my reaction because she immediately asked me does it really taste that horrible? I said it no it's not about that, I just can't handle the chewy textures. I told her it has nothing to with the taste or her baking and not to take it personal.
Unfortunately she did. She told me I'm ungrateful and I could just take few bites and tell her I will save the rest for the later like a normal person.
I apologized and said I don't think I will be able to take more bites. That really upset her. She said fine I will fucking throw them away then and throw them into garbage. She was so upset the whole time and decided to not stay over so I gave a ride . She was upset during the ride too and slammed the door when she was leaving.
I don’t know how to feel all about this. AITA?
ETA: “I actually remember telling her about it once but she must have forgot, because she said she didn’t know , or maybe I misremember, probably the latter. Because after I told her I’m not good with the chewy textures , I asked her “I actually told you this once don’t you remember?” and she acted like she was hearing this for the first time ever and swore I never told her about it”",,t3_1gw0he1,AITA

He suggests we get the biggest platter since it has everything. The platter comes with 4 sides so I ask him what he wants. He picks one side and says I can choose the rest. I'm looking at what's available while also considering what he likes because I know we're going to share all these sides (plus I'm not a picky eater like him). There's two sides that I want to try but I don't want to order it if I'm the only one that's going to eat it. So I ask him a question about each side and whether he wants to try it. He says yes to one and no to the other. Okay great, one more side to pick then I can place the order. Then he messages me and and asks if he should place the order instead. I'm like, okay sure? At this point, I'm confused and then he goes on to say, ""I told you to pick and you keep asking me. We're not getting BBQ anymore."" WTF?! is my initial reaction and then I realized he told me to pick the rest of the sides. But just to be sure, I ask him if my questions annoyed him to which he said, ""yeah.""
I wasn't trying to be annoying at all. I'm a fucking people-pleaser so I'm automatically considerate of what he likes but I see how my questions would've been annoying.

I will try to keep the short, but our story is a long one.
My (31F) husband (38M), has owned his own business since 2010-ish. That is where we met in 2012, fell in love and within two years, got married and had a child.
He had two kids from a prior relationship and we had them frequently and eventually 50/50 (for the last 7 years or so). It took a little while, but his BM and I became very close and are good friends to this day.
After working with him for about two years, I moved on to a different job that offered benefits for our family and an opportunity for advancement. His income over the years has been sporadic at best and not dependable so I have solely been responsible for the majority of bills. When we get into a jam or need a lump sum of money, like for car repairs, he does typically figure it out, but again no dependable income coming in.
On top of being in charge of both managing and paying finances, I have been the primary caretaker for our children and our home. I constantly have to ask him to help with chores, especially any kind of deep cleaning, and managing of the kids schedules. Literally if I don’t ask, nothing gets done. And if I’m having an off day or week, no one is picking up the slack.
Don’t get me wrong, I know I am not perfect. I admittedly suffer from depression and that can cause my general attitude to vary greatly depending on the day but I’ve always been very supportive of his business and our family. In so many ways, this man is wonderful to me, but in some of the big ways, he continues to fall short, no matter how much I communicate my needs. I honestly feel if the business wasn’t part of the equation and he brought home steady income we would all be happier!! He is very smart/talented and capable of finding work just about anywhere.
At the beginning of this year, we had a conversation about the business and I told him that if things didn’t get better this year, I felt he needed to shut it down. We are now in late November and it’s been the same story again this year. So I told him he needs to make a decision and start positively contributing to the family so that we can have the future we keep talking about. AITA?",,t3_1gwjlgj,AITA

They have, and always have had a horrible relationship. My Mom has bipolar, she is on medication but it's still an issue. I try to be understanding of this when navigating issues that come up, but sometimes I have to stand my ground, defend myself, and set boundaries. My sister set her own boundaries with her, which is not allowing her kids alone with her, due to my Mom's outbursts she's had infront of the kids. So on a particular night, my Dad was babysitting the kids, my Mom asked if she could be there, my sister declined. Which brings us to my mom texting to vent. I told her I wish things weren't that way, trying to be gentle and understanding without getting overly involved. Eventually my Mom said ""the whole family doesn't like your sister"" and that my sister was the cause of that. So I politely said I can't have this conversation if it's going to be gossip. I'm here for her but not if she's going to be bashing people I care about. She was pissed. I let it go for a few days, hopeing it would just blow over. I decided to break the ice by sending a video of my son and a quick message about my schedule in regard to me taking my Dad to his dr appointments. Everything seemed good, till she blew up on me again, telling me to ask my therapist the difference between venting a gossiping, telling me I'm mean, and just kept going on. I had to block her. I'm pregnant with 2 kids, exhausted, under alot of stress and I just can't handle it.

Anyways I've let that go but have had issues with her overall entitled nature (along with that said nature in her children as well). My dad seems to see it mostly only in my technical older stepsister. He talked to me about how he spoke with his wife about issues (basically stood up for me and my brother). We also talked about the older stepsister and I having a recent message exchange about Thanksgiving, where we were cordial with each other. He said it's good I don't get too close but also am cordial. I've come to accept he's a ""keep the peace"" type
Anyways when he mentions something about them still being family. I immediately said they aren't. He said something like don't stoop to their level and antagonize, what about when us kids have weddings and such occasions-it won't look nice, etc. I immediately said people do when they're old enough (as I am and have been the only financially independent one thus far too). Am I right about that-that people don't owe time or invites to even supposed family members they no longer want contact with? He said okay in our native language in a semi convinced way.
But yea-AITA for saying that ? Also relevant is I did tell him before that going forward I want family time I'm involved in to be me, him and my brother only. Hard to say how serious he realizes I am about pretty much wanting no or low contact with technical stepfamily.",,t3_1gw8bmj,AITA
FitEstablishment42,AITA for asking my ex to move out by the end of the week?,2024-11-21T05:57:59.054000+0000,451,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw9fnb/aita_for_asking_my_ex_to_move_out_by_the_end_of/,"I (21F) live alone in my apartment, and my ex (22M) has been staying with me since August because he was in a tough spot. At the time, I agreed to let him stay temporarily, and even before we broke up, I told him he would need to move out sometime in December. For context, he hasn’t contributed to rent, utilities, or any other expenses while living with me. And I didn’t even ask because I wanted him to get back on his feet. About 3 weeks ago, we broke up. Since the breakup, things have gotten really tense. We argue all the time, and it’s so bad that I’m pretty sure my neighbors can hear us fighting. On top of that, I’m in the last month of my semester, I work two part time jobs, I have exams coming up, and worrying about my bills so I’m extremely stressed. All of this has made it impossible for me to focus on my studies or feel at peace in my own home.
Today, we got into another argument because he was being really loud while I was trying to study for an important exam. I asked him to quiet down, and he told me to leave and study somewhere else out of the apartment. It was almost midnight by this point. That was the last straw for me. I realized I just couldn’t do this anymore.
I told him he needed to leave by the end of the week instead of sometime in December, as we originally planned. He got upset and now I feel awful because Im going back on what we agreed.
So, AITA for asking him to leave sooner than planned?",,t3_1gw9fnb,AITA
Agile_Topic2353,"AITA for Kicking My Niece Out of My House for Lying, Stealing, and Disrespect?",2024-11-21T16:26:14.842000+0000,61,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwj9qm/aita_for_kicking_my_niece_out_of_my_house_for/,"I (26M) kicked my 17-year-old niece out after her repeated lying, stealing, and disrespectful behavior. She initially stayed with us to care for our dog while my mother worked night shifts. We were close at first, but things deteriorated when I moved back home after losing my job.
The Backstory When I returned, I noticed she was miserable, having lost contact with her friends. Feeling sorry for her, I overlooked behaviors I wouldn’t normally tolerate. After three months, she reconciled with those same friends, whom I considered toxic. Her behavior changed - she contstantly stayed up all night being loud, neglected her cat, and left the house messy for my mother to clean. We warned her to take care of her cat, but she ignored us and even started using towels to mop up cat urine and hiding them in the laundry. This escalated to the point where my allergies were triggered, and I told her the cat had to go. Despite multiple warnings, nothing changed.
The Lying and Stealing I started noticing her lying frequently. Money had previously gone missing from my mother’s purse, to which she was the culprit, and I caught her stealing my mother’s necklace, although I didn’t confront her immediately (due to above). More recently, she lied about small things, like stealing my water bottle, which she hid in her wardrobe. The constant dishonesty broke my trust.
The Breaking Point A few nights ago, I asked her to be quiet as I needed to sleep in order to get up in the morning to pick my mother up from work. Instead, she continued laughing and yelling. When I confronted her, she lied to my face, claiming she hadn’t been noisy. That was the last straw - I kicked her out.
Why I Might Be the Asshole
I wasn’t perfect as a teenager, so maybe I should’ve been more understanding.
I let my frustration build instead of addressing issues earlier.
Kicking her out could be extreme, especially since she doesn’t have a proper space at her mother’s house.
Why I Might Not Be the Asshole
I gave her multiple chances to change, but she refused.
Her lying, stealing, and disrespect created a toxic environment for me and my mother.
At 17, she’s old enough to understand basic respect and responsibility.
Kicking her out was a last resort after trying everything else. It wasn’t about being cruel but about maintaining boundaries.
My sister is angry, claiming I’m hypocritical and that my niece doesn’t have a proper room at her mother’s house. I feel like my niece used this as an excuse to act out, thinking she wouldn’t face real consequences.
TL;DR: I kicked my 17-year-old niece out after repeated lying, stealing, and disrespect. My sister says I’m overreacting and hypocritical because I wasn’t perfect as a teenager. AITA?",,t3_1gwj9qm,AITA
Scared_Mine5154,AITA for asking our Friendsgiving group to help cover the cost of turkey?,2024-11-21T11:41:58.191000+0000,138,196,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gweayt/aita_for_asking_our_friendsgiving_group_to_help/,"Some background: I’m a grad student at a university very far from where my parents live. I have a small group of friends who are in a similar situation and I often host them for dinner around the holidays. In particular, Friendsgiving has become something of a tradition for us, and we usually celebrate with a potluck-style dinner at my apartment.
This year, turkey is a bit more expensive than usual, so I kindly asked each person who’s planning to come to our Friendsgiving meal to contribute a small amount ($12) to help cover the cost of the turkey. Most of the people I asked gladly agreed to help out, but one of my friends refused and said that he didn’t want to come to Friendsgiving if people were going to pay for the food. He told me that Thanksgiving should be about gratitude, not bean-counting, and that everyone should just bring what they’re able. I told him that I agree that Thanksgiving is about gratitude, but my roommate and I are poor grad students, the turkey is by far the most expensive item, and it’s not fair to us that we have to bear the cost of it alone. I also pointed out that every year, in addition to the turkey, my roommate and I prepare most of the traditional Thanksgiving foods, like pumpkin pie, stuffing, cornbread, gravy, sweet potatoes, etc., whereas many of the other guests usually just bring a small salad or some fruit—and we are not asking for help with any of the side dishes—only the turkey. In spite of this, my friend still says that he doesn’t want to come.
Normally I would let this go and just try to celebrate Thanksgiving without him, but he is one of the more “popular” members of our group, and I’m really worried that if he doesn’t come to our Friendsgiving this year, other people will cancel as well. Honestly, the whole situation is leaving a bad taste in my mouth and it makes me not want to host Friendsgiving at all.

I will call my foster parents ‘Henry’ and ‘Erin’. I got a new phone as an early christmas present from my biological dad, it is an iphone 16 pro max, which is the phone I wanted so I am very happy about it. My previous phone was an iphone 11 and it was bought by Henry and Erin.
On my old phone Henry and Erin had set up loads of parental controls on it, so I couldn’t download any apps without them approving it, I couldn’t turn off share my location, I couldn’t change my passcode, it would lock everything except their contacts at 8pm every night until after school and they had a timelimit on youtube so I could only watch it for 30 mins within the time where my phone was unlocked anyway and I could only go on websites that they approved off (like there was a list that I could go on and I couldn’t go on anything that they didn’t manually add to that list). These all really annoyed me, but whenever I asked for them to be turned off they told me that they bought the phone and so these were the rules.
Now I was given my new phone by my dad on monday and I haven’t used it yet because they’re telling me that I have to let them put the same restrictions on the new phone as they did my old phone. I said no because that isn’t fair, I should be allowed to use my phone as my dad says because he paid for it. I said to them that my dad paid for the phone so it was his choice and that he doesn’t want me to have those restrictions on.
But now they’ve changed and said it doens’t matter who bought the phone even though that was their whole point before. Now theyre saying that because I am living with them I have to follow their rules and the rule for having a phone in this house is that they put restrictions on it. I don't think that is fair at all considering they didn’t buy the phone?? I don’t see how they can do this?
Before I got home from school on monday they took the phone out of the box my dad sent it in and set up all the restrictions and now I’m trying to figure out a way to take them off. I am thinking about complaining to my social worker because it is not fair that they put these restrictions on my phone even though they didn’t pay for it?

They had a thing and then she found out she is pregnant. My grandparents were angry and kicked my mom out and she moved in with my dad. They married and then not long after they divorced. But they were really close as parents still, always calling each other best friends. I always lived with my dad because i was a typical ""daddys girl"" and my mom was happy because she got to be young and try build herself up by finishing school and then she started her own business.

MinxAlbatraoz,AITA for always telling the freshmen that it's just a hazing? ,2024-11-21T02:07:19.718000+0000,503,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw55ax/aita_for_always_telling_the_freshmen_that_its/,"English isn't my first language, so please overlook any mistakes.
I'm finishing my second year on Software Engineering. On my first semester, news went around about a presentation worth 50% of our grade, and that it was already too late to submit it.
Now, I'm gullible af due to autism, and also have severe anxiety. Being a nearly straight-A student, I'm always attentive to deadlines, so it came as a complete shock for me. They messed with the college website's front end to forge prints, and being my first time doing online college, I wasn't familiar with the system, and couldn't find any information.
It's important to say that there was a point when I reached out on one of their DMs and begged the person to tell me the truth, explained about my anxiety and everything. They persisted, and everything spiraled from there. I was soon on the ER due to a strong anxiety attack, since I didn't had any meds at home, having been previously able to keep it under control.
Now, every time they pull this stunt on freshmen, I straight up tell them the truth. The ""pranksters"" are mad that I'm ""spoiling all the fun"", and that ""they need to learn not to trust everything people say"", and that ""they went through the same and are fine"". The point is: I hate perpetuating this kind of cycles, and hate the mentality of ""if I had to suffer, so do you"". Therefore, I refused to stop, and they're saying that I'm not preparing these kids for the ""corporate life"", that they need to learn to handle the pressure, etc. I responded with ""I doubt any corporate would continuously gaslight their employees with a non-existent deadline, and even if they do, we've reached the point where they could end up being rightfully sued"".
They're all mad at me, and a friend even pulled me aside and said I should just let them because ""boys will be boys"". I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I really need unbiased opinions.

gremlinlurking,AITA for losing my boyfriend's money?,2024-11-21T16:59:55.040000+0000,32,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwk44b/aita_for_losing_my_boyfriends_money/,"I (31F) and my (29M) boyfriend (H for placeholder name) have been together for 3 years and seem to constantly face issues related to vacation planning, finances, and my travel anxiety/brain fog.
Edit;; I should preface I'm not broke because of this. I just don't want to be anywhere near broke or drop back to average credit score because of someone else's choices (that crap is hard to build up once you get into the 700s and above). Unnecessary struggle is not for me.
Key Points:
On a previous trip where I booked the tickets, H said he'd handle the hotel because he wanted to stay somewhere nice, the hotel didn't take cash despite me asking him to confirm- leading me to cover it all including food and entertainment. This caused me to use my credit card excessively, impacting my financial planning and credit score. After we got back from that trip I was so overwhelmed I just sat on the couch and cried. He finally came around and paid me back for the hotel expense. But not the rest. (The entertainment, food, and taxi costs) I explained that I have too much going on to be fronting all our travel expenses. Especially when he has less bills than I do and makes more.
On this most recent trip, despite agreeing to bring adequate cash and split 50/50, he had me deposit the hotel money in my account and then only provided $300 for personal expenses, insufficient for a week in an expensive city. After telling me he'd bring plenty. I had previously warned him about my financial limits this time due to medical bills and that I was not going to be able to comfortably survive after the trip if I had to pay more than agreed.
When I found out he only brought $300 I told him this is becoming a pattern and it doesn't feel like he respects me or how hard I work. He said I was bringing up the last vacation all over again for no reason and it was manipulative and if I was so insecure financially to get another job and stop relying on him.
After our return, he provided me with another $300 for expenses, but handed it to me when I was already in bed almost asleep. He tried to take some of it back by saying I didn't technically need $300 for groceries and $200 should suffice.
In the morning I couldn't find the cash anywhere. So I asked H if he could help me find it or if he remembers where I put it.
He accused me of being irresponsible and not taking care of my finances. And was absolutely livid that I'd lose his money like that and said that's why he can't trust me with anything.
I did find the money later with his help, sitting on his fireplace under a candle.. I thanked him for helping me but he was so mad he refused to even look at me and asked for space. That upset me so I yelled at him and told him that his lack of empathy towards everything I've already had to deal with is astounding and shit happens so he shouldn't be taking it out on me or giving me such important stuff when I'm already asleep. Especially when he leaches off of everyone he knows to live comfortably.
We haven't talked since.

samozvany,AITA for not contributing the full amount for a group birthday gift for a friend?,2024-11-21T07:53:40.158000+0000,154,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwb4tq/aita_for_not_contributing_the_full_amount_for_a/,"My friend group (approximately 20 people) have a vague tradition that whenever someone celebrates their birthday and throws a party, most people attending that are closer to them create a group chat and discuss gifts for them. Usually, this amounts to approximately 4-8$ for each person (equally divided), and usually, there is about 15-20 people contributing. Considering the size of the group, such a present is usually once every 1-2 months. At the beginning, people have the opportunity to leave the conversation if they don't want to partake.
I had a birthday party with one other person who has birthday close to me a few weeks ago, and obviously we weren't part of the planning (of the presents), but my wife was and because most people contributed about 4$ and some didn't pay at all, there was approximately 50$ unpaid she had to pay (and for my taste, the gift was too expensive anyway, I actually would be completely fine with a cheaper one). The same was for the other person and his wife.
Now last week, another friend F29 threw a birthday party. I couldn't attend, but I was added to a group where the gift was discussed. I said I won't attend but I can chip in, expecting the regular present value. I didn't have time at all to react to the chat because it was created a day before the party (on a working day). When I opened the chat in the evening I see a payment request for 20$ each (there were only about 10 people and they chose a very expensive present).
I said that I didn't get to have a word in the selection process, I'm not even attending and that I think it's too much money, given that it's almost triple what is usually asked. I didn't want to pay the full amount, but as I said, I will chip in - with the standard amount being 8$, and that is being generous, since most people pitched in with 4$ for my present. To that I got angry reactions that I should've said something before, that we're adults so we give adult presents etc. I argued that I didn't have time to react and that for my present a few weeks ago, my wife had to pay a lot from her own pocket and even then, the present was about half the price of this one.
TL;DR: I feel like I was somehow forced into contribution to buying an expensive present for a friend despite the fact that usually we go for much cheaper ones and divide into more people, but at the same time, I feel like I may be TA because all I'm doing by making a point is forcing the organizer to pay my share out of their pocket, as the number has been divided into 10 people including me already.",,t3_1gwb4tq,AITA

Today, I needed to Google her obituary because I wanted to pass on the correct link to some colleagues and I found, to my disgust, that the obituary link through the funeral home was no longer the top Google result but rather a link posted by a company called Echovita.
After contacting the funeral home to let them know, I've been down a bit of a rabbit hole this morning. It turns out that there's a whole cottage industry that uses AI to scrape local obituaries and then post a slightly altered version with links to ""Send Flowers"", ""Light a Candle"", ""Plant a tree"", etc. From what I've discovered, of course, the money doesn't go to those things but just goes straight to the owners of these sites.
There's a link on the false site to request it be taken down, but who knows whether they'll comply. More to the point, the fact that its there tells me that they're well aware of the scummy thing they're doing but will only desist if asked to. That means many grieving families may not even be aware that some ghoulish scumbag is trying to profit off their loss.
I've reported this through the FTC and my State Attorney General's office, but if I had to guess, the sites are probably owned offshore with no real recourse.
I'm not here to fish for sympathy, so I'm not posting the actual links, but I'm trying to make as many people as possible aware of these types of scams so that they can forewarn their families and friends to be extra careful to check whether an obituary is legitimate before clicking on any links.

I have been expressing open distaste for this since I was 15, but I let my family continue using it for a while (because they're family) until about five years ago when I started actively & consistently correcting them. I deeply despise this nickname as it feels patronizing as an adult and they all know that.
Cut to last night. I went over to my parents' (62M,F) house to have dinner with them and my brother, Toby(32M), for my birthday. Yesterday was a tough mental health day for me and I said as much when I got there. We started discussing plans for Christmas as my parents will be traveling to visit other family. As we're finishing up dinner & discussing possible alternatives, my mother starts ""Toby, you and Lyssy can..."" and I interject with ""Alyssa"". It's at this point, my mother slams her hands on the table, says, ""You know what? Fuck Christmas!"" and storms off to her room. My father finishes clearing the table, and I very calmly say to Toby that I've been complaining about this for years and I'm done being polite about it, he tells me he doesn't want to get involved.
I spend the next few hours watching TV with my dad as my mom stays in her room. She doesn't even come out for birthday cake. When I go to leave, my dad tries to insist I go talk to her. I tell him the same thing I told my brother, and pointed out that you wouldn't deadname a trans person or use the wrong pronouns for Toby's NB partner, this isn't okay either and I'm allowed to be upset. He starts in on me about how I need to cut her some slack because I don't understand how much pain she's in all the time (she has autoimmune/chronic pain), or how tired she is because she's not sleeping. I also have chronic pain & insomnia and said as much, and pointed out that if any one of her children behaved the same way, it wouldn't be okay. He continues to insist that I should go talk to her, implying that I'm in the wrong because my correction ""sounded snotty"". I said flat out that we'd talk eventually, but I just wanted some space to process my feelings before talking, that's how I've always been. ""So she slipped. When was the last time she slipped?"" This past Sunday, and I said nothing about it. ""She corrects herself with other people and corrects them!"" Yes, but she never corrects herself in front of me, and that hurts me. He tells me to do ""whatever the fuck [I] want"". Through this, Toby has re-entered the conversation. Just before I walk out, he says, ""Alyssa, stop looking for reasons to hate Mom."" I've never felt white hot rage flare through me like that, but I held back from cursing him out and just left.
So AITA for holding a boundary and wanting to cool off before talking to my mother about this?",,t3_1gvwq3l,AITA
unusually_basic,AITA for avoiding my mother when she smokes and not spending time with her?,2024-11-21T17:52:18.130000+0000,19,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwlhup/aita_for_avoiding_my_mother_when_she_smokes_and/,"My mother has always been smoking, and it's always kind of bothered me.
I live in the same appartment with my mom and dad because I'm not financially stable enough to leave yet and am studying. Whenever she smokes, she only does so in the kitchen or the living room, and makes sure to open the window and close the door so that none of the smoke or odor goes into my bedroom.
Problem is, it's become unbearable lately. I find myself immediately leaving the room she's in when she starts smoking because the smell gets stuck to my hair and clothes. And it's not just that. When I'm on the phone with her, I feel extreme discomfort just hearing her smoke. It's never really affected me this much before. Last week I went to my boyfriend's house, and while we were hugging he told me my hair smelled like cigarettes. I immediately started sobbing and pulling at my hair before rushing to the shower and washing it.
I've always found it difficult to spend time with my mother because of how she's treated me during my childhood. She left a lot of scars. But now it's become impossible for me to stay in her vicinity for over 30 minutes. I don't know if this brand of cigarettes is getting worse over time, or if I'm the one having enough.
Now, I know I'm hurting my mother by staying away from her, but she has no excuse. My sister offered multiple times to pay doctor appointments for her to get rid of her addiction. I mean it costs us about 400€ a MONTH, just to buy her cigarettes! And whenever I bring up her addiction and how she needs to get rid of it, she threatens to shut me up, doesn't want me talking about it.
Being around her has simply become unpleasant, and I'm already planning to move out ASAP, but this is only fuelling my desire to get away from her. How am I supposed to handle this? I can't imagine being in her shoes, and frankly I never ever want to. But am I in the wrong?",,t3_1gwlhup,AITA
fullmoon_123,"AITA for ignoring my dad when he is in a bad mood because he ignores and treats people badly when he is like that, even though my mom tells me I shouldn't do that because he is my dad",2024-11-21T11:29:58.526000+0000,62,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwe490/aita_for_ignoring_my_dad_when_he_is_in_a_bad_mood/,"So I am working part time while I finish university and I work with my parents in their office... This means we spend a lot of time together, I do not live with them anymore but I see them for a little more than 6 hours every day of the week and then on weekends I also visit them frequently. So you can say that we spend a lot of time together.
My dad is the type of person that holds things and grudges in, if something goes wrong in his life he shows it to everyone by putting on a bad face. It's literally always been like this since I was little. At this point just coming in for the day and seeing that he is in a bad mood just increases my anxiety tenfold and I dread having to talk to him. This is because when you do try and talk to him about something you either get solemn silence or just a short, passive aggressive answer that just makes you want to crawl into a hole and disappear. Oh yeah and if you do insist on keep talking you'll probably just make him angry and he'll start shouting.
My mom's response to my dad being like this has always been to walk on egg shells. She goes extra hard to try and make conversation, even if every try is met with absolute contempt and makes everyone in the room awkward. Never once she has stood up to my dad and tell him he shouldn't put on this face with everyone.
Last week he was in a bad mood, and I also didn't have the best day since I was having a small fight with my boyfriend at home so I just got into the office and wanted a calm day. But of course my dad was in a bad mood. I tried to be cheerful at first and was met with just a horrible face that made me want to cry but I just shook it off.
For the rest of the day I was silent, didn't make any conversation, just ignored my dad like he ignores me. At the end of the day I just gave a quick goodbye and left. My mom called me, telling me ""that's not how I have to deal with my dad, I have to be gentle with him because he is my father and I should always have a smile on my face and try and make normal conversation with him so that he stops being in a bad mood"" and that I ""left without even looking at him and that my dad told her he took offence to that"", etc. I just rolled my eyes (because this is a reoccuring thing, my mom always wants us to just go around acting cheerful with our dad when he is like this and looks at us like he literally hates us at times) and told her to get herself and my dad to therapy because I was just so tired of all this.
My dad is really sweet when he is in a good mood, and I love him very much obviously. But sometimes I do feel like we're suffering from something like ""stockholm syndrome"" or something because I find myself getting so relieved when my dad is in a good mood, that I just forget that he can be kind of cruel, if I am being honest, when he is in a bad mood.",,t3_1gwe490,AITA

I'm year eleven secondary, I'll leave the guessing game of my age to you, she is 34 or so.
My youngest siblings is an 6 year old boy with autism and ADHD named William. Not that this has to do with any of it.
So the dinner arrives, and we all get our stuff expect for William not getting his nuggets. I feel bad for him, of course, but I was starving too. I had an long day at school as always, and just wanted to shovel it down so I can go to sleep.
Upon learning my little brother doesn't have any nuggets, she looks at me and asks me to give him some of mine. I had six and hadn't even touched them yet. Now, usually, I would give them to him, but when I said I was starving.. I meant it. I said ""do I have to? I don't really want to. "" I care for my little brother but I was looking out for myself for once.
This led to her telling me to ""fuck off upstairs to my bedroom"" and my step dad (33) calling me an dickhead. Reminder.. I'm still an minor too.
So I HAPPILY take myself and my dinner upstairs and continue to eat.
I'm still quite mad about this. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not, or if I'm in the wrong.
I'm always the first to offer people my food, even before I can take an single bite myself. People used to use me as an walking mat but I stopped letting myself be such a while ago.
I'm conflicted. The first time I say no and think of myself like everybody tells me to I get backlash for it. I wanted to eat too.
Edit; Important things to mention;
I have ADHD and autism as well. I cannot eat certain things.
I have an eating disorder and are very under weight for an teen.
My little brother did NOT go hungry. They put nuggets in the oven for him and he was as happy as an bunny.
I am not hurt by what she asked of me, just more hurt she wanted to put another child before me.

They have asked my mom and I to reserve a day to spend 8 hours (possibly more) watching their 1 year old baby, my niece. Meanwhile, they want to go off and do MDMA together all day. I love my niece and she's an easy baby, but I also don't know much about taking care of a baby, and my aging mother hasn't doesn't it in over 30 years, especially for this long. They have left us with their baby for 4 hours before while they went to a movie when they visited last time (baby was 6 months old). We played with her, fed her, put her down for a nap.
So, part of me is thinking, “okay maybe it's not that hard to take care of the baby for a few hours.” But I really don't want to for that long, especially so they can go off and do drugs. It's not like an emergency and they needed me. On the other hand, I get that it's their ""date day,” and they don't often get to be alone just the two of them anymore, and she just finished breastfeeding last month, thus she is more free now with what she puts in her body.
I'm also concerned that my mother and I will have questions and they will be unreachable for so long. It's not my obligation to watch their kid! That's the bottom line I'm trying to tell myself. But I still feel like an a-hole for wanting to say no to this.
TLDR: my brother and his wife want to leave for a day to have a date day to do MDMA. Am I the a-hole if I prevent them from going on their date day because I don't want to watch their baby for 8 hours?",,t3_1gvzlak,AITA

She blames me if they misbehave, and she expects me to put my homework aside to help them do theirs. It's gotten to a point where I've failed assignments because I was busy watching my sisters.
Now I simply ignore my mom when she calls me to deal with them, which makes very upset to the point where she storms into my room and curses me out.

We thought living together would be a good idea, but it’s been a disaster. Before he moved in, I lived alone and kept the apartment spotless. Once he moved in, the place became a mess. After the first week, he left cooked food on the counter and stove for days, splattering grease everywhere. I couldn’t even use the kitchen.
I tried to talk to him about it, but he belittled me and didn’t take it seriously. So, I told my parents, and they tried talking to his mom, but she brushed it off and said he’d clean it. He did clean, but then claimed I should’ve just talked to him. However, the situation kept getting worse. About a month ago, I got sick and went home for the weekend. When my parents came back to help me with food, they were horrified to find the kitchen covered in trash and dirty dishes, the smell was unbearable. We ended up cleaning for 3 hours. Afterward, my parents called his mom again, and she yelled at them, calling them crazy and saying they had no right to be involved.
Now, we’re back to the same issue: the counter is covered with food, including rotten meat, eggs, and dairy, which has been sitting for days. I texted him to clean it up, and he said he would the next day, but he didn’t. I’ve been unable to eat properly this week, and as a collegiate athlete, it’s affecting my performance. So, I took all of his food and put it in two bags, leaving it in front of his bedroom door.

I 26m work from home and just had a really lethargic day. Not sure why, mightve been bad sleep or long day of work or illness or something, but I was really tired by around 645.
Around 7:30 when she gets home I greet her as usual and start to help get some things out for dinner. But I’m hit with a wave of sleepiness and really want to lay down so I go and lay down and I let her know I’m tired.
45 mins later I’m woken up by her telling me to get up and asking what’s wrong with me, so I tell her that I’m really tired and just want to keep sleeping. This answer is unacceptable and she spends the next 30 mins interrogating me about why I am tired. No answer I give is good enough, im just exhausted and want some sleep. She says I must be lying about the situation and something else is going on, and grills me if I did some sort of drugs or if I’m sick or something bad happened. I keep reiterating that im just tired and want to sleep but the answer is still not good enough.
She calls me “fucking inconsiderate” and “weird” , accuses me of lying, and other things for the next half hour, says we’re broken up and fake packs bags, and i continue to try to reason with her. I try to explain that I really was just tired and I wasnt sure why and don’t have a good explanation for it. we agree to disagree and move on with the night after an hour.
today im feeling better about things but she says we should finish talking about the issue. She tells me again that i could be more communicative and that this is triggering for her, that it seemed like there was some sort of ulterior motive, that i was being a dick for not spending time with her and going to sleep instead. I explain again what i said yesterday, that i was tired, and probably overwhelmed and just wanted the day to be over with. This was still not acceptable. She aggressively questioned again why i would go to sleep, saying it would be stupid because i would just wake up in a few hours, and selfish because i wasnt spending time with her, and that I was punishing her by shutting off and not responding. She called it weird that someone would sleep from 8 pm until the next morning. She was fuming when I kept repeating my reasoning from yesterday, that I was just tired, and basically painted me as an asshole for going to bed early.
When i asked if there would be any way i could be sleepy and go to bed early without that being weird or offensive to her, she said no.
AITA for going to bed early? In retrospect I wish I maybe communicated with the clarity I have now that I was overwhelmed and wanted to be alone, on top of being tired, but in the moment i just felt super sleepy.",,t3_1gw6ngs,AITA
solanabreaux,AITA for not inviting my sister to my annual Friendsgiving?,2024-11-21T06:30:35.439000+0000,100,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw9xxz/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_annual/,"I (20F) graduated high school two or three years ago with a tight group of friends that i’m still in touch with now. Every year since our graduation the week before thanksgiving, we get together and reunite with a friendsgiving. Every year it’s been the six of us, we always make sure everyone can go and that it’s ALWAYS just us six.
This year, I planned to host the annual friendsgiving at my house. I’ve been super excited about this, and have been thinking about it since September. When I flew home yesterday morning for my break, My parents and younger sister (16F) were super happy to see me. Later that day, the subject of friendsgiving came up and i asked my family if they were able to be out of the house for the night. I found this perfectly reasonable, since they all know how passionate I am about this reunion. My parents agreed and said they’d already planned out being out for most of night. However, my sister asked if she could participate in the event.
Now I have nothing against my sister, she’s kind, funny, and can get along with most people. However, she doesn’t know my friends AT ALL. Not even their names. Could she get to know them? Sure! But not on friendsgiving. I’d rather the night not be about her trying to get to know everyone and instead about catching up with each other. I tried to explain to her that this is one of the only night in the year I get to see my friends and i’d rather she not interfere. My mom hearing this, immediately began asking questions. She thought it was silly and selfish of me to not let her participate, as my sister is such a sociable person, it wouldn’t matter if she doesn’t know anyone. OK, fine. But there also the considerable age gap. My sisters a fresh junior in high school, while we are all juniors in college. She won’t be able to relate or talk about anything we’ll be talking about. And some of my friends have already turned 21, so chances are we’ll all be drinking, while my sister won’t be able to.
My mom argued back saying that I should let her participate or else I wouldn’t be able to host the party at my house. This BROKE me. I got so upset, nearly on the verge of tears. My sister just sat there and watched, guilty of starting an argument. My dad finally decided to chime in. He said he understands my point and thinks it’s unreasonable to make me invite my sister to the event.
This dilemma has caused a split in my family, and as far as i’m concerned, i’m currently still going to host the friendsgiving at my house. And i’m also afraid this may affect our relationship for the remainder of my stay at home. I don’t want to be split with my mom and sister for the ONLY week i get to see them through the year.
With my friends, only two of them actually really know my sister, the other three only really know her name. They basically expressed that it’s my house and i’m hosting so i can invite her if i wanted to, but i got the impression that they didn’t want her around. So please lmk if IATA
edit: Hey just wanted to clarify some things:
i can see why some would view the idea of me “kicking my family out” as “entitled” or unreasonable but i can assure you it isn’t. i have been asked to leave the house MULTIPLE times when i was still in highschool by my sister and complied every time. and when i couldn’t i would simply stay in my room for as long as she needed, only coming out to use the bathroom and get food. If it wasn’t clear before we grew up in a pretty comfortable household, so there are plenty of things to entertain ourselves with.
My sister is perfectly capable of going out for the night, as she gets out of the house as much as she can. asking her to be out for a few hours isn’t unreasonable. And also, i’m not “Kicking” anyone out. I just asked she try to stay out of our way. (the dining room and part of the kitchen). again, our house is quite big.
Sure, the wording “my house” was wrong. It’s my parents house. However my parents were more than happy to let me use their house for the night. And yes, i asked about this months in advance. i didn’t just decide to host without discussing with the rest of my family. And if it matters, I have a job lined up for when i graduate college and plan to move out as well.
I admit i left this part out due to word count, but i didn’t explicitly want them out of the house. I was perfectly fine with them staying in a different part of the house.
Anyways, thanks so much for the feedback. I can certainly see why i might be the asshole in this situation. I’ll try to reflect.",,t3_1gw9xxz,AITA
PotentialAnalyst8969,AITA for insisting that my bandmate help me load gear after a show?,2024-11-21T10:02:01.079000+0000,53,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwcuef/aita_for_insisting_that_my_bandmate_help_me_load/,"My (38m) bandmate (36f) and I played a show tonight. The band is made up of the two of us as equal members, and we have a few friends/hired musicians help augment the rest of the lineup.
Everyone took off after our set except for her and I, and we stayed until the end and started packing up. We made a plan to go to a taco truck together before going home. The taco truck was located right near our rehearsal space. I said cool let’s just drop off our gear by at the space quickly and then get tacos.
She said, oh I’m too tired to load the gear. I just wanted to get tacos and then go home. Basically assuming that I would then drop everything off myself. She said something like, “you knew I woke up early this morning and had a lot of work today.” But throughout the day she had never once asked me if I could load the gear at the end of the night alone. The problem with this is last week after a different show I unloaded all the gear myself, then went to her apartment and helped load her stuff in there too.
She got upset tonight that I insisted that we both load the gear together and then go get food. We got in a huge fight. She said, “I could have just left early like the other guys.” The thing is, they’re friends doing us a favor by playing with us, and both of them notified me in advance and were extremely thankful. She’s a full band member, and just assumed I wouldn’t care without ever telling me she wouldn’t be loading the gear in advance. It ended up taking me 15 minutes alone. Would have taken us 7.5 minutes together and then we could have gotten food.
She was extremely pissed at ME for not automatically assuming that of course she wouldn’t be dropping off the gear. That I was lucky she even helped me at all. She basically made it sound like I ruined the good vibe between us for the night by saying I thought we should both be loading it equally.
Am I the asshole for not backing down and insisting that yes I think she should have helped, or at least asked me if I wouldn’t mind loading myself if she wasn’t up for it?
Edit: I want to add that on my way to load the gear alone, which I ended up doing because she drove off angry, she called me and said I ruined a fun night by telling her we’re a band so we should both load gear. She said I was “guilt-tripping” her.
TL;DR - My bandmate got upset with me for insisting that we both unload the gear before we got food at the end of the night after a show. She said I should have known that she was tired cause she was up at 6am that day. She never asked me if I minded doing it myself, just got upset when I asked her to help. I didn’t back down and kept saying I thought we both should do it together. AITA?",,t3_1gwcuef,AITA
jetletter,AITA for not lending my brother money when he could lose his condo?,2024-11-21T19:54:27.071000+0000,5,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwokrf/aita_for_not_lending_my_brother_money_when_he/,"I (35f), my brother (37m) and sister (39f) all inherited money when our father passed away in 2022. Since then, my sister has spent all her money, my brother and his wife bought a condo in Florida (which used all their savings) and I have about $40k in my savings.
Recently, my brothers building has had unexpected HOA fees pop up that are out of their budget, a roof which cost them $6k a few months ago and now it's a $4500 fee regarding upkeep of the shared parking lot. Typically I would never disclose my finances even with family, but since he is aware of what we all inherited he's always been a bit obsessed about asking how much I have left, what my plans are etc, essentially keeping tabs with it.
My partner and I are currently 6mo pregnant and we're doing pretty well for ourselves, but we live in Manhattan and it's insanely expensive to the point where I am kinda needing to pull from my savings more often than i'd ever like to and now that we are expecting a child I feel hyper protective of what nest egg we do have in case of emergencies, medical costs etc.
So last week he called me a bit intoxicated and said he really needs help with the $4500 that is now due at the end of the month. He said his wife has some checks coming in and he will pay me back as soon as they get the money. I wasn't super comfortable with the conversation and did my best to avoid it, basically saying something along the lines of 'why don't we wait and see if the money comes thru and if not we can talk.' Yesterday he texted me and said ""Doesn't look like we are going to get the checks in by the end of the month and it would be incredible if we could borrow the money from you! Super annoying i know, we are sorry."" I responded with, ""I'm really sorry you're dealing with this fee, but I just don't have that kind of money right now. With the holidays coming up and medical bills for the baby i'm tapped financially. I budgeted out the month and I can send you $150 if you need money for groceries, but that's all i can spare rn.""
Now for even more context, my brother and sister are both unreliable people. My sister who i realize is not super relevant to this story, handles her finances very poorly and will ask to borrow money from me every 6 months or so, my brother has asked before but not as often. My sister has never paid me back and my brother has managed to get things together in the past to where I don't recall ever lending him much, maybe a couple hundred here and there but never got anything back. But I say this because he knows he can't ask my sister for help and our parents have both passed, which basically leaves me, his little sister.
He is now saying the they could lose their condo and I am being an AH for not lending him the money when they're clearly struggling. I am doing my best to keep things afloat for my partner and I and really don't want to pull from my savings, not knowing I will 100% get it back.
So AITAH for not lending them money?",,t3_1gwokrf,AITA

Prior to 2020 we (whole family), loved going to the farm and helping out. In 2020 I had major heart surgery, since then my health has declined, now have heart issues and COPD. Initially after my health declined I still enjoyed going and helped out where I could.
The last couple times we've gone they have asked I not participate in any activities and to stay inside. I would spend the majority of my weekend by myself. When I asked if I could help with something or what was going on, I was told that ""I was always in the way"", ""too slow to do anything"". I 100% respect the fact that it is there property and there rules, and I in no way try to influence that.
However I felt very isolated and emotionally drained as I felt like a burden, a failure, that i wasn'tgood enough. I brought up Kris how I fellt when we got home and she brushed me off.
Earlier this year the Kris was supposed to go by herself to the farm to help, but I was in the hospital so she stayed home to watch the kids. Originally we were going to host Christmas (Wifes family gets together over New Years to celebrateChristmasas a family group. However after Kris her brother (I'll call him Paul) and their sister had a chat they decided to switch New Years to the farm. I understand why they are doing this and I support it.
I talked to Kris and explained that I would not be accompanying them. I told Kris IA would help get everything ready and if she needed the utility trailer I'd get it hooked up and ready to go. But that for my own mental health I thought it'd be best if I just stayed home since I wouldn't be included in anything anyways. I went on to explain I wasn't trying to influence Paul on how he ran his farm. She retorted with the fact that being in the barn, or running around outside with the kids, or being near a campfire could be dangerous for me. I explained that it was sitting catching pneumonia or another respiratory virus was what was dangerous from someone else. Whe accussed me of having FOMO

Oscar has a half-sister, Elise (8F). Their dad Matt (56M) is a surgeon and often works long and unsociable hours, so we often look after Elise, and we both absolutely adore her.
A year ago Matt married Diane (47F), who doesn't like kids. If he's working late, Diane brings Elise over to ours and we cook dinner, help with homework, play with her, put her to bed etc. Diane often stays until around midnight. We offered to go round to theirs instead so Elise's sleep wasn't disturbed, but Diane said she'd rather come to us.
As much as I love Elise, I'm getting really sick of the intrusion into our life. Oscar and I don't get much time together, and now a lot of it is spent entertaining Diane. We don't watch much TV - we're both PhD students, so we often spend evenings writing, reading, preparing classes, or just talking and listening to music. Diane only wants to watch TV, but never makes any suggestions for shows or movies, instead complaining about how we don't have all the streaming services she has. When we find something, she spends a lot of time on her phone, or trying to point out ""plot holes"" which often amount to characters making decisions that she wouldn't personally make. I can't enjoy or even follow what we're watching, so I started reading books on my phone to pass the time.
The other night, I had some work to do after dinner, so I excused myself. After I finished, I stayed in the study and read my book. I honestly wanted to go to bed, but Elise was sleeping in there and I was too tired to face Diane at that point. When Diane was leaving, I came out to say goodbye and help with Elise. Oscar asked how my work was going and, thinking nothing of it, I said great, I'd finished it and had started the book he recommended.
Diane didn't say anything, but the next day Oscar got a long message from Matt about how unwelcome we'd made her feel: I should have finished my work before she arrived; it was unfair to make her watch a foreign-language movie when she hates reading subtitles; I made her feel like she was annoying and I didn't enjoy spending time with her, and I disrespected Oscar by leaving him alone. He said Diane now felt uncomfortable bringing Elise round again and was completely overwhelmed by the thought of looking after Elise by herself.
Oscar doesn't think I'm in the wrong, but I should apologise anyway just to smooth things over. Initially, I thought Diane was overreacting, but now I'm worried that I was disrespectful. I did effectively just go and sit by myself instead of spending time with her, and I chose not to come back after I had finished my work because, in that moment, I didn't want to spend time with her. Honestly, I'm worried that I've spent too long around students/academics and I've lost sight of the fact that it's not normal to sit alone reading instead of entertaining guests.

It's not that I'm terrified of babies, I'm just not ready to hold a baby again after loosing my first born son when he was 5 weeks old in April of this year. His passing was unexpected as I had a healthy pregnancy until the week before I had to have an emergency c-section due to him being in distress. Unfortunately, he suffered major brain damage during labor and delivery which caused his death.
I still can't talk about all of the details to anyone without bawling and I get triggered easily around babies, especially around babies that I know the parents of.
I believe that I will have a hard time being around my Brittany and my niece as I hold resentment towards Brittany as this is her fifth baby.
This will be the first time that I have seen Phil and Brittany in almost a year as we live in different states and they didn't reach out at all after my son passed. So I don't know what the interaction will be like and if I'm going to be asked to hold my niece.
Obviously, I am happy for my brother as this is his first baby and he's really happy. I just also have that resentment towards him as well, which isn't his fault.

I (24F) work full time over night shifts at a factory, my department is understaffed which results in mandatory overtime, which means working 12hr overnights for what is sometimes months at a time (2 months straight right before this happened). My little sister (20F) is a full time college student about 2.5 hrs from me. I'm still living at home saving up to move with my bf. About maybe a month ago my little sister messages me that her school is celebrating a religious holiday so classes are canceled for that Friday and asks me to pick her up that Thursday after class.
I don't sleep before picking her up and got home at 8pm Thursday. I couldn't fall asleep when I got back so I went to work on no sleep. When I got home from work Friday dad and sister were awake and we end up going out. They bring up a few times that they're planning to go to a festival Saturday and how I should go with them and that they plan to leave at 10am. I tell them I'd probabky be sleeping as I'm so tired from working all those 12hr overnight shifts and reminding them that I still hadn't slept from Wednesday. We get home at 1pm so they can watch the hockey game and I can try to get some sleep. While the game is on they start enthusiastically screaming at the game and jumping around. While venting to my bf he tells me to go just go there. When leaving, my sister and dad remind me that I have to be home in the morning so we can leave at 10, even though I had told them I couldn't. I was really tired and tired of hearing how it's just a little sacrifice for my sister and how I always choose my bf over them (I spend most weekends there) so I say I'll try. I get to his house at around 3pm and after tired crying about some things they said to convince me and how loud they were being, I finally fell asleep and didn't wake up until around 3pm Saturday, after they went and came back from the festival. I wanted to leave when I woke up, but my bf was really worried for me to be driving because I still looked exhausted and asked me to drink some coffee and watch an episode of a show. Halfway through the episode I ended up passing out again. When I woke up and went home Sunday she was back at school. My dad went off on me for blowing off my sister, telling me I had to text her an apology. Apologies to my lil sister tend to be an invitation for her to be nasty, since I didn't feel like I had the mental energy so I put it off until she brings it up. I also feel like I did sacrifice for her and had nothing left. She never brought it up to me, but I found out she called my older sister (27F) who lives across the country,saying I'm selfish and we aren't on speaking terms and that i dont see the family bc of bf, when my older sis called concerned that I was in an abusive relationship.

I (29F) had an argument with my friend (32F). Earlier, she had been debating ending her relationship, and after weeks of back and forth, she decided to leave. I asked if she was sure, and when she confirmed, I joked, “Guess we should start laughing about it—you’re back to the streets with me!”
She got upset, saying it wasn’t a laughing matter. I explained that humor is my way of coping and tried to soften it by saying I was happy she was listening to herself. That made her even angrier; she said I wasn’t taking her seriously and didn’t respect the gravity of the situation.
Later, she mentioned a death in her family in a sarcastic tone (“Hahaha, now it’s a death in the family, lmao”), so I wasn’t sure if she was joking or not. I responded with a question mark before apologizing and explaining her tone threw me off.
When we saw each other, she was still upset, and I apologized again, but she wouldn’t let it go. At one point, out of frustration, I snapped: “This is why people can’t stand you—you’re nuts, and they leave.”

I’m writing this down, because my friends and I have been really conflicted with this situation. To start, our former adviser (M) for about 2 years now, out of nowhere messaged one of my friends today about us (our class), not remembering to greet him a “happy birthday”. Personally, I don’t think it’s a big deal, since years have already passed since and we’re not that close or even related to feel obligated about his birthday. Actually, this isn’t the first time it happened. last year, he went all sulky about it as well, how we didn’t greet him and all that (some of our classmates did though, including my circle of friends). However, he did some absurd post on his facebook story. it’s quite hard to translate it in english, but it went something like “i’m cutting you all off now”.
(I mean obviously it’s a joke, but it’s still so strange)
Also, some of the people in our class did greet him this year over his facebook post. Though I must admit, we weren’t one of the students, because our week was really hefty and just so frustrating. It a hell week, to be exact. But, I guess we had some fault on our hands as well, it was easy to comment a birthday greeting. Even so, our excuse was that even if that was the case, it just seems so troublesome to even comment a birthday greeting. Our whole schedule was packed with schoolworks, that it just didn’t occur how we should even insert that greeting in. And again, it’s not our responsibility.
It just seems so weird to me/us, because again, we don’t have that deep of a connection to begin with. We have a typical student-teacher relationship, so I don’t get how he’s becoming so upset about it? Though, I don’t think he sees us like that lol. When we still had him as our adviser, he was already so freaky. He would get grumpy and moody over such small things. It’s kind of like he’s showing some sort of obsession with us, it’s so unsettling tbh.
Right now, my friend hasn’t responded to the message, because we really don’t know how to sort it out with him. So, it would be gladly appreciated if we could get some advices from you guys, on what to say. And also, are we the ones at fault in this situation?

Together 10.5 years. We have no kids and live in our house with our elderly dog. We are both from a small city, and a few years ago decided to move to a bigger city nearby.
In recent years, close friends and family have started families and ask to come stay with us when in big city, with their small kids.
Our house isn't really kid-friendly, I child-proof best I can to make it safe for guests. I prepare toys, snacks, Disney+, make it a friendly place. I generally enjoy spending time with the kids in my life.
My husband's sister's youngest son (5) has severe behavioral issues. He's been kicked out of 3 daycares and has diagnosed with ODD and ADHD. My SIL comes over for days-long visits with her 3 kids, and he is a huge challenge. He knocks furniture over, throw things around, he's broken several of my items. He snoops in every single room, constantly. Opens every drawer and cupboard to pull things out. SIL ignores it, I'm the one chasing him around trying to stop him. I am so uncomfortable having my personal spaces invaded.
I once found him snooping in our bedroom. He grabbed something very inappropriate from a drawer and was about to run into the main room with it when I grabbed it.
I'm the only adult trying to stop him. Husband and SIL do and say nothing. I tried setting boundaries of rooms that are off limits with my most personal items, but they were ignored.
As well, my husband's best friends have a 4 year old boy who is very disrespectful in our house. He insults us, screams at my dog, snoops around, wipes his nose on couch pillows and his parents don't do a thing. I don't expect perfect behavior, I just want decent manners and respect in my home.
Now, whenever these specific people ask to come stay with us, I'm filled with anxiety and dread.
During SIL's most recent visit, my husband allowed nephew into an off-limits room and he broke a little Lego item my friends' kid made me. Afterwards I told him how I felt about it and that I was struggling with my discomfort.
He was offended. ""Every time kids come over, you have a complaint/ kids will be kids / you need to lighten up."" Said I'm overreacting about the Lego and it wasn't a big deal. I said the point is that a boundary of mine had been ignored and an item was broken, again.
I explained I have no problems with kids if they can behave. I mentioned the incident of nephew handling a bedroom item. My husband said that I shouldn't let it bother me, and to try to find it funny instead.
I know a big part of his defensive reaction is because SIL's family is the only real family he has. I understand that he's trying to just have a good time with them in his home without negativity.
I want to mention I've always conveyed my concerns to him in a respectful and mature way. I still wonder, if I'm actually TA here and maybe I'm being too negative when my husband is just trying to enjoy time with what little family he has left.",,t3_1gwqvh6,AITA
Select-Sale6630,AITA for doing nothing to my roommates ,2024-11-21T18:25:22.006000+0000,7,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwmcd6/aita_for_doing_nothing_to_my_roommates/,"I live with 4 girls let’s call one of them sam. we have been having issues with sam leaving her dishes in the sink for weeks at a time never cleaning taking out the trash etc. We have texted our groupchat and it multiple times and sam never replies. I have 2 cats and was going to visit a friend for the weekend. I asked one of my roommates Sally if she could watch my cats and just feed them as they have an automatic litter box and i would pay her. I get home from my trip and no one is saying a word to me at all. I give Sally the money and she says thanks and that’s all. Then at 10pm i’m playing video games in my room and my other roommate lori texts me and asks if I can turn it down. I turn my volume down to 10 and shut my door and ask if it’s still bothering her and i never got an answer. I woke up the last 2 mornings to all the lights being on and this bothered me because i sleep with my door cracked so the cats can come and go. I’m especially close with one my roommates mara and she also has not really said much. I texted the groupchat asking if they could shut the lights off in the kitchen when done because i have a hard time sleeping. Lori texts the groupchat about being more respectful with noise and leaving things around in the common area. I text her privately and ask if my volume was an issue last night to which she responded how inconsiderate I am how I leave multiple boxes in the kitchen and living room area and how they all have a problem with me and left the light on on purpose because they knew it would bother me. when I got home from my classes, I looked at all the boxes that were in the living room and kitchen and they were all addressed to Sam so it was evident they were not mine so I figured since they think I’m inconsiderate I took everything I bought for the apartment and put it in my room because I always do dishes on time. They said multiple times Sam is the girl they have a problem with and I leave for the weekend and suddenly I was the problem. So I’ve decided to stop doing anything around the apartment. I took out the trash last night, but I probably won’t be doing that again if they want to see what an inconsiderate roommate is like then I am more than happy to show them. Also wanted to clarify, I’m not going to go out of my way to make the apartment messy or do things to spite them. I’m just no longer going to be helping out and cleaning up peoples messes like I used to. EDIT: some of my roommates are not as well off as i am and i totally get that whenever they need paper towels, certain dishes oven mitts trash bags dish soap sponges etc they always ask me to buy it and i always do and have no problem. I definitely pull my weight more with buying things especially decorations and other essentials and no one really provides those except for me so i am no longer going to be buying those things.",,t3_1gwmcd6,AITA
justmamacita,AITAH for refusing to hand over my grandmother's jewelry to my cousin who was promised it first?,2024-11-20T02:52:17.002000+0000,9366,914,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gvfjpz/aitah_for_refusing_to_hand_over_my_grandmothers/,"My grandmother passed away last year, and she left me (24F) a beautiful jewelry collection in her will. Growing up, I was very close to her, and we spent countless weekends together where she would let me try on her pieces. It always felt like our little thing, so when she left them to me, I was deeply touched.
Here’s where it gets complicated. My cousin (28F), let’s call her Emma, insists that my grandmother “verbally” promised her the collection years ago, even though there’s no mention of her in the will. Emma claims that the jewelry is hers by right because she was the oldest grandchild and used to model the pieces during family events when she was younger. She’s even told everyone that my grandmother’s decision must have been a mistake or made under pressure.
Emma called me last week, demanding I hand the jewelry over to “honor” what she says was my grandmother’s real wish. When I said no, she called me selfish and accused me of stealing what was meant for her. The family is now divided, with some saying I should just give Emma a few pieces to keep the peace, and others telling me to hold my ground because the will was clear. Emma is now posting passive-aggressive messages on social media, making me out to be the villain. I feel terrible because I don’t want to cause family drama, but I also believe my grandmother knew exactly what she was doing when she left the collection to me. AITAH?",,t3_1gvfjpz,AITA
sanctionsanity,AITA for moving out of my shared apartment with my sister because she has a new boyfriend? ,2024-11-21T03:34:18.551000+0000,78,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw6wcf/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_shared_apartment_with/,"TLDR: My sister is in a new relationship and I feel like I need to move out our shared apartment.
Context: I lived in a studio was happy but there was water dripping from ceiling so could move but was not a desperate need. My sister was in a long-term relationship and needed to move apartment - her boyfriend was leaving in due course and she couldn’t afford apt on her own - she asked me if I would live with her and I signed lease with her and moved in 6 months later when her boyfriend left.
Situation: Sacrificed my space. She has the master room, I have tiny bedroom, right on the street, that goes up to 30C in summer, it’s cozy enough that I make It work but only agreed because was living with her (and got benefits of it). I left for the past two months on holiday and she got into a new relationship very quickly.
A week after I left for holiday, her and this new man were  living full-time with his cat in our apartment - she has not spent a day apart from him (since they met 2 moths ago). Some of my shit went missing, and some was ruined. (Also Their relationship feels quite toxic and intense but she is blind in love).When I came back I told her I’m not ok with it, and so she’s done everything she can to make me comfortable - e.g. spending all her time at his house (haven’t spent proper time with her since being home), and they only come at the weekends so they can party in the city (I am trying to get sober and it''s hard with that in my space). The apartment is small to start, and this new life my sister is living is affecting me so I said I would move out. (My parents would cover my half of rent for her - and she would be able to live with him here if I was gone). I feel resentment towards her. I don’t want to move out but need to to protect my peace. We have been fighting, and she can’t understand why I would move because of her, she thinks I have a victim complex, and she’s upset that I haven’t been overtly positive about her relationship. She does not seem sane right now, her friends are all worried about her. I have tried to be open minded but I feel I have lost my sister.  AITA for beefing and having attitude with her about this? And for feeling resentment towards her for me having to move?
Any perspective is super welcomed x",,t3_1gw6wcf,AITA
No-Lingonberry-4997,AITA: My Ex Girlfriend is making it hard  to get my clothes back,2024-11-21T20:50:25.515000+0000,4,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwpxrv/aita_my_ex_girlfriend_is_making_it_hard_to_get_my/,"So i dated this girl for around 5 months after I graduated from high school. I showed her a good time and was a good boyfriend . She went to college and i stayed to work for my family’s business for a year. We were going to do long distance for the year and then the plan was for me to meet her at college. I honestly thought we could work out….. but long distance was harder than i thought. So i decided to break up with her after a few weeks of contemplating what was best for both of us. I didn’t think it would be a good idea to make the 3 hour drive up to her just to break up. I thought it might have hurt her feelings more than if we talked about it over a phone call. So when her roommate broke up with her boyfriend i initiated the conversation…. I thought I let her down really easy. I didn’t want to do it over the phone but it seemed like the best option. I dropped my Ex’s stuff off at her family’s house which is 30 minutes away. I text her a few times trying to figure out a plan to get my stuff back. She says she doesn’t have time to come drive down and offers to mail it back but she wants me to pay for it. That didn’t sit right with me. I don’t think its right for me to pay to get my stuff back. Its not even that much stuff it’s just a few shirts and a jacket or two.
Anyways fast forward 2 months and i’ve been busy pretty much everyday with either work, hunting with my dad, or hanging out with my friends. I’ve completely forgotten about my clothes and my ex sends me a ( pretty aggressive) text. Saying that it’s basically been too long and that she’s going to donate my stuff. Which i don’t really have too much of a problem with. She also says that it isn’t her responsibility and that she doesn’t need to give any effort because of the way i ended things. I asked her to take a picture of my clothes because some of them could have sentimental value. I told her that i would pay for her to mail back my stuff but now she says that she doesn’t want to.
I’m too sick to go to work right now so i guess i could drive up if the clothes turn out to be important to me. I don’t know what to do. I hold no hard feelings for my ex but she is making me frustrated. Her friend also sent me a text telling me how lazy i was for not driving up there ( i’ve been working pretty much everyday ). Also first post on reddit and i hope i chose the right subreddit to post this story on.",,t3_1gwpxrv,AITA
